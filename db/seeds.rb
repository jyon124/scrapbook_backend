"content": "For money you wouldn’t need for more than 10 years, which ONE of the following do you think would be the best way to invest it—stocks, bonds, real estate, cash, gold/metals, or bitcoin/cryptocurrency?
That question was recently asked of more than a thousand investors in a recent Bankrate survey, and the winner—by a large margin—was real estate. For every two respondents who answered stocks there were more than three who said real estate is the way to go.
Are these investors onto something? Have financial planners been wrong all these years? For this column I mine the historical data for answers.
On the face of it, the respondents to the survey need to go back to their history books, as pointed out in a recent column by my colleague Catey Hill. Since 1890, U.S. real estate has produced an annualized return above inflation of just 0.4%, 
as judged by the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index and the consumer-price index. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.88%  (or its predecessor indexes) did far better, outpacing inflation at a 6.3% annualized rate (when including dividends). 
Even long-term U.S. Treasury Bonds outperformed real estate, producing an annualized inflation-adjusted total return of 2.7%. If this were the end of the story, then this column could end here.
But it’s not the end. The stock and bond markets are currently so overvalued that it’s not only possible, but downright plausible, that real estate will do better than either of these asset classes over the next decade.
Maybe the investing public is smarter than we give them credit.
Let’s start by considering bonds’ prospects over the next decade. Currently the 10-year Treasury is yielding 2.1%, which is just 0.3 percentage points higher than the break-even 10-year inflation rate. (The break-even rate is the difference between 
the yields on the nominal and inflation-protected 10-year Treasury.) So the market’s best judgment right now is that your return above inflation over the next decade will be just 0.3% annualized.
And if inflation is worse than the market currently expects, bonds will do even worse.
Next let’s consider stocks’ prospects. Forecasting equity performance is much more difficult than in the case of bonds, given the far greater number of factors that can impact their returns. But you should know that, according to almost 
all standard valuation metrics, stocks currently are somewhere between overvalued and extremely overvalued. Furthermore, you cannot explain away this overvaluation because of low interest rates.
Given this overvaluation, it’s entirely possible that stocks will join bonds over the next decade in falling far short of their historical averages. How far short? By way of a possible answer, I refer you to the 10-year forecast compiled by Research Affiliates. 
They currently are projecting that the S&P 500 (including dividends) will produced an inflation-adjusted return of just 0.5% annualized over the next decade, and that long-term U.S. Treasury bonds will produce an inflation-adjusted return of minus 0.7%.
Or take the 7-year forecast from Boston-based GMO. They are projecting that the S&P 500 will produced an inflation-adjusted total return of minus 4.2% between now and 2026, with U.S. long-term Treasury bonds losing at a rate of 1.1% annualized.
These are just projections, of course, and other firms are more bullish than these two. But, at a minimum, these two firms’ forecasts suggest that the respondents to the Bankrate survey aren’t necessarily as ill-informed as might otherwise appear.
Real estate during stock bear markets
There’s one other factor that should be considered when deciding whether real estate or equities is the better bet for performance over the next decade: How will real estate perform during a major stock market decline? Given our all-too-fresh memories of 
real estate’s awful performance during the financial crisis, you may be avoiding real estate because it’s even riskier than stocks.
But real estate’s experience during the financial crisis appears to be the exception rather than the rule. In every other stock market bear market since the 1950s, the Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose in all but one. And in that lone bear market 
prior to 2007 in which the index did fall, it did so by just 0.4%. (I discussed real estate’s performance during stock bear markets in an article several years ago for Barron’s.)
Furthermore, you should know that the Case-Shiller index has been less volatile than the stock market—a lot less. As measured by the standard deviation of annual returns, in fact, the Case-Shiller index is only 40% as volatile as the overall stock market. 
Perceptions to the contrary that real estate is riskier than equities derive from the leverage we typically use when purchasing real estate. Note carefully that the risk comes from the leverage, not real estate inherently.
So if you were to believe there is a major stock bear market in the cards at some point in the next decade, you might choose real estate just because of its lower risk."

"content": "An American cryptocurrency boss was arrested at his luxury apartment in Thailand after he allegedly scammed investors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
John Barksdale, 37, from New Jersey, was detained by immigration police at his plush villa on Koh Samui, Thailand after complaints about his 'Ormeus Coin' product.
According to Coinmarketcap, the Ormeus Coin was worth more than $48m dollars in December 2017 before it plunged in value. It currently has a market cap of just over $1m.
Footage showed him emerging from his room without a shirt on before being lead past his swimming pool with stunning ocean views and bundled into a police car.
Officers have detained Barksdale in Bangkok, 480 miles away, while they investigate the complaints against him. Barksdale is listed on the coin's website as a lead 'advisor and investor' in the product.
Two alleged victims, Daranee Plusker and Bob Steed, complained to police in Bangkok last month that they were deceived by the American businessman in 2017.
They said they spent about 100,000 USD on the cryptocurrency startup known as Ormeus Coin - a type of alt coin similar to Bitcoin. Police say that the total alleged damage is $325,000. 
Plusker and Steed said that Ormeus Coin promised them 100 per cent profits shortly after their investment.
But the investors claimed they followed the progress through the website for years and had never earned any profitable income. They also alleged that Barkdale had changed the website and become unreachable since they complained.
Pathumwan District Court issued an arrest warrant for alleged fraud on July 8, which led to the arrest in Suratthani province.
The suspect admitted that he was the man named in the warrant but declined to answer other questions by local interrogators.
According to the police, Barkdale had escaped the warrant to Koh Samui where he also operated a luxury resort business on a mountainside.
Police Colonal Suparerk Pankosol, Superintendent of Suratthani Immigration, said: 'We found that the suspect fled from Bangkok and lived discreetly at his resort.
He allegedly carried out an overseas fraud, with alleged damage equivalent to 10 million baht. He will be taken to Lumpini police station in Bangkok for legal action.
Barksdale has yet to respond to the allegations."

"content": "Recently U.S. treasury yield curve inverted to flag a possible future economic recession. Economists are getting nervous due to inverted yield curve historical correlation which accurately indicated the previous 7 recession cycles.
The cause of this can often be attributed to a weak economy which causes inflation to drop below the healthy zone i.e. 2% as seen by the U.S. Federal Reserve for the economy to thrive. The annual inflation rate for the United States is 1.6% as of June 2019.What is an Inverted Yield Curve?
An inverted yield curve occurs when long-term treasury bonds have a lower yield than short-term treasury bonds. Inflation can be the cause attributed to why short-term rates move so rapidly.
What are treasury bonds?
Backed by full faith and credit of the U.S. government, treasuries are considered to be a low-risk investment. Investors that purchase these Treasuries loan the government money. The government, in turn, makes interest payments to these bondholders as compensation for the loan provided.
Historically, inverted yield curves have accurately forecasted U.S. recessions. Hence, this type of yield curve is considered to be a valuable indicator of future economic recession, however, it can take years to playout.
A recent example is when the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted in late 2005, 2006, and again in 2007 before U.S. equity markets collapsed. The curve also inverted in late 2018 and now in Aug 2019. 
How it may impact Bitcoin price and other cryptocurrencies:
In the beginning: 
When this occurs, investors tend to turn to safe options, such as defensive stock like food, oil, etc. or safe-havens like gold, which are often less affected by downturns in the economy. Unlikely for investors to bet big during this time on volatile assets.
Post rate cuts:
The U.S. Fed may react with more rate cuts to correct the course. Lower interest rates will stimulate economic growth, as lower financing costs can encourage borrowing and investing. 
As a result of lower borrowing costs, institutions will be investing more in newer technology and blockchain projects may be an attractive place. DeFi projects (lending) and Crypto exchanges may have an edge over other blockchain products or services.
Aftermaths of steep rate cuts:
Worth mentioning, when rates are too low, it could spur excessive growth and subsequent inflation. Due to rising inflation, the value of the dollar declines, as its purchasing power erodes with each increase in the price of basic goods and services. 
Therefore during economic turmoil, Investors (Bitcoin maximalist) may be more than likely to bet on Bitcoin price rather holding USD."

In an increasingly cashless society, our everyday payments are being tracked and monitored by third parties in an attempt to learn our habits so they can advertise to us more effectively. Tracking our shopping habits to market to us might not be that nefarious, 
but in some parts of the world this same technology is used to suppress free speech or even effect one's social credit score, as in China. While more free societies haven't gotten there yet, it could become a very slippery slope, and Lightning Network payments may just be the way to curtail such activity.

"content": "Saying Bitcoin Cash is lightning fast and posting a video where a transaction is completed within 15 seconds, Ver undoubtedly knew that he was creating a minor controversy. 
'Bitcoin Cash is Lightning fast.' A top comment on the tweet accused Roger Ver of being a liar: 'Newbie Public Service Announcement! If Roger lies to you about zero conf being a valid transaction, he will lie to you about ANYTHING!' Ver, however, is not lying.
Zero-confirmation transactions are not only allowed but encouraged in both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Ver recently had a debate with crypto personality Tone Vays.
As Bitmain, a company which loudly supported the Bitcoin Cash fork through its mining power and its CEO Jihan Wu, wrote before the launch of BCH:
Bitcoin Cash will be pretty much the same as BTC minus a few things, like the Segregated Witness (Segwit) implementation and the Replace-by-Fee (RBF) feature.
Replace-by-fee is a feature in Bitcoin which allows a user to replace one version of a transaction with another with a higher fee, often guaranteeing that a miner picks up the second transaction. The first version of the transaction then becomes invalid.
The replace-by-fee controversy came to light again when several Canadian men stole millions of dollars in Bitcoin from various cryptocurrency ATMs across the country. RBF's inventor Peter Todd told CCN at the time:
The simple truth of the matter is that the ATM operator in question is negligent if they are accepting unconfirmed transactions without other mitigating security measures such as obtaining positive legal identification; the fact that they're asking for help in 
identifying the thieves is a strong sign of such negligence. This is no different than, say, a store selling high value items choosing not to hire cashiers and instead relying on an 'honesty box' for payment.
Lack of a convenient replace-by-fee mechanism in Bitcoin Cash definitively gives zero-confirmation transactions a higher degree of safety.
The feature is only primarily useful in Bitcoin when used to get a transaction through a congested blockchain. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, ROGER
Nevertheless, the eternal wisdom in this industry has always been to wait for at least one confirmation before considering a transaction settled at all. Bitcoin currently has a hashpower of over 75 exohash compared to Bitcoin Cash's two-plus exohash. 
That means that a minority of rogue miners from Bitcoin could easily create havoc on the Bitcoin Cash chain, if zero-confirmation transactions were the norm and enough activity took place on the chain.
Bitcoin Cash can shake this threat by switching to a mining algorithm not currently supported by BTC miners, although it would cost their mining network significantly.
Bitcoin Cash proponents rightly argue that 10 minutes – the standard window of time between blocks in BTC or BCH – is a long time for an in-person transaction.
Cash settles as soon as it changes hands, with a receipt issued if necessary. To be digital cash, whatever technology succeeds will have to mimic this behavior.
Responses to the tweet ranged from excellent to awful, in terms of counter-trolling. Here are some examples. Factually, it's true that accepting a zero-confirmation transaction is a leap of faith. It's also true that every time you accept fiat cash, you could be accepting counterfeit versions worth nothing at all.
The last thing the BCH network likely wants is a reputation for easily-stolen goods. The chain has already suffered reorganizations and undergoes regular hard forks."

banks and financial institutions from providing services in relation to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies are digital 
currencies, in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of the currency units and verify the transfer of 
funds, operating independently of a central bank. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Surya Kant said that it will take up the 
matters seeking regulation of cryptocurrency  at the later stage and would first deal with the batch of petitions challenging the 
RBI circular of last year. According to the April 6 circular of last year, the entities regulated by the RBI are prohibited from 
providing any service in relation to , including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or 
sale of virtual currencies. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) opened the arguments in the case and said that 
the RBI had banned cryptocurrency on moral grounds as no prior studies were conducted to analyse the effect of these virtual 
currencies on the economy. The association contended that the RBI circular has barred all the entities regulated by the apex bank 
from providing services to any individual or business dealing in virtual currencies like cryptocurrencies. Counsel appearing for IMAI 
argued that the blockchain technology adopted in these virtual currencies was not disputed and therefore a blanket ban was arbitrary, 
unfair and unconstitutional. The counsel referred to a RTI reply given by the RBI in which it was said that no study had been undertaken 
by the top bank and not even any committee had been constituted to study the effect of cryptocurrency on the economy. The hearing 
remained inconclusive and would continue on August 14. In 2013, the RBI in an advisory cautioned users, holders, and traders of 
virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related 
risks that they were exposing themselves to. The RBI had on April 6, 2018 last year had said that it had repeatedly cautioned users, 
holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual 
currencies. On July 3, last year while hearing a plea of IMAI, the top court had refused to stay the RBI circular prohibiting banks 
and financial institutions from dealing with the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It had sought response from RBI, Finance Ministry and 
Union ministry of Information and Technology."

"content": "The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) on Thursday told the Supreme Court (SC) that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had banned cryptocurrency on ‘moral grounds’ as there were no studies the banking regulator conducted to analyse if these virtual currencies were actually harmful or not.
In its challenge to the RBI’s circular barring banks from dealing in virtual currency, the IAMAI said while the underlying technology called blockchain was not in question, a total prohibition on cryptocurrency was uncalled for.
It its arguments, the IAMAI said there was a reply given by the RBI under Right to Information, where it had accepted that no study had been undertaken by the RBI and neither had any committee been formed to analyse the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency, before banning it.
The apex court, after hearing the submissions made by the IAMAI, asked it to prepare a chart and cite instances or judgments from other countries which have regulated cryptocurrency, instead of banning it.
The RBI has maintained that owing to ‘significant spurt in the valuation of many virtual currencies and rapid growth in initial coin offerings’, virtual currencies were not safe for use. It had, in 2013, cautioned ‘users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, 
about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks that they were exposing themselves to’.
The RBI had on April 6, 2018, said it had repeatedly ‘cautioned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies, including bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies’. As a follow-up to those warnings, it had barred all entities which are regulated by the 
RBI from either dealing in virtual currencies or providing services to those dealing in such currencies.
“Such services include maintaining accounts, registering, trading, settling, clearing, giving loans against virtual tokens, accepting them as collateral, opening accounts of exchanges dealing with them and transfer/receipt of money in accounts relating to purchase or sale of virtual currencies,” the RBI had then said.
Earlier this year, the banking regulator had also told the SC that bitcoins and virtual currencies were ‘harmful’, and that it had asked banks not to provide any banking services to digital currency systems as it did not want it spreading like ‘contagion’.
Though the top bank had disassociated itself and the entities it regulates with bitcoin, it had decided to promote the use of blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology is the backbone on which bitcoin and other virtual currencies operate. Former finance minister Arun Jaitley had earlier said the government doesn’t consider cryptocurrency as legal tender and will take all measures to eliminate payments using them."

"content": "Yesterday, President Trump took to Twitter to castigate the U.S. Federal Reserve for not cutting rates swiftly enough. Noting that three countries—New Zealand, Thailand and India—each announced surprise rate cuts on Wednesday, Trump said the Fed was not keeping pace:
[The Fed] must Cut Rates bigger and faster, and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW… We will WIN anyway, but it would be much easier if the Fed understood, which they don’t, that we are competing against other countries, all of whom want to do well at our expense!
The tweet followed a similar comment Trump made immediately after the Fed’s July 31 rate cut:
What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China, The European Union and other countries around the world … as usual, Powell let us down.
This idea of competitive easing conjures up the concerns raised recently by the legendary hedge fund investor Ray Dalio in a 7000-word piece titled “Paradigm Shifts.” It’s a piece that a number of investors have brought up to me recently as one reason they are making an allocation 
to bitcoin and crypto. Dalio, of course, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge fund managers in the world, with over $124 billion in assets. Bridgewater’s strong returns over the past four decades have made Dalio the 25th richest person in the world, 
with a net worth in excess of $18 billion. He is arguably one of the most important investors of our time.
In his “Paradigm Shifts” post, published July 17, Dalio notes one of his investment principles is:
Identify the paradigm you’re in, examine if and how it is unsustainable, and visualize how the paradigm shift will transpire when that which is unsustainable stops.
He goes on to argue that essentially each decade in American investment history has been defined by a single investing paradigm or “norm.”
His worry is that current monetary policy is about to force us from our present paradigm into a new, unpredictable and potentially wealth-destructive one.
Specifically, he believes the power of quantitative easing—and thus the ability of the Fed to manage the economy and stem future financial crises—is fading due to its overuse and an unwillingness to allow a recession. 
This concern is compounded by exactly the kind of early-easing activity that we saw from the Fed on July 31, and made much worse by the prospect of a downward spiral of competitive global rate cutting and QE one-upmanship.
With the impact of QE fading, Dalio expects to see policymakers turn to other methodologies to help bail us out of the massive debt loads currently carried by investors around the world. He writes:
To me, [as we enter this new paradigm], it seems obvious that [central bankers] have to help the debtors relative to the creditors. At the same time, it appears to me that the forces of easing behind this paradigm (i.e., interest rate cuts and quantitative easing) 
will have diminishing effects. For these reasons, I believe that monetizations of debt and currency depreciations will eventually pick up, 
which will reduce the value of money and real returns for creditors and test how far creditors will let central banks go in providing negative real returns before moving into other assets.
Almost on cue, President Trump and U.S. lawmakers have started pushing for ways to lower the value of the U.S. dollar. With China now labeled a Currency Manipulator by the US Treasury, expect more to come. Meanwhile, Fed futures are pricing in an additional 75-100 basis points of cuts in the next six months.
This uneasy state of monetary policy is not just a U.S. phenomenon: The ECB is predicting more rate cuts and additional QE in the fall, and there is already more than $15T in negative-yielding government Treasuries, mostly in Europe. Beyond that, UBS is now charging investors a 0.75% fee per year 
if they deposit more than 2 million Swiss Francs with the bank, and other banks are expected to follow suit.
In this environment, Dalio says:
[I]t is ... a good time to ask what will be the next-best currency or storehold of wealth to have when most reserve currency central bankers want to devalue their currencies in a fiat currency system.
So what do you do?
Dalio believes that in this new era of currency devaluation, cash and bonds will not be reliable stores of value. Historically, scarce real assets such as real estate, gold, commodities and—we’d point out—bitcoin are safe havens for wealth and a source of returns in these environments.
Dalio’s specific recommendation is to buy gold, which is not surprising, as it is the best-established nonsovereign store of value. But with bitcoin’s continued progress—the head of the Federal Reserve himself recently referred to it as “digital gold” and a “speculative store of value”— Dalio’s 
statement is about as ringing an endorsement of bitcoin and other store-of-value cryptoassets as I have heard .
If Dalio, one of the most successful investors of our time, is right, these developments increasingly make an allocation to crypto a prudent hedge, if not a necessary one.
As the Fed continues to cut rates—and more cuts are currently expected in September—expect to hear the concerns about unstable monetary policy, the use of currency devaluation as a political tool, inflation and “what happens next?” to get louder and louder.
What a time to be alive."

"content": "Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has revealed that it is being blackmailed to the tune of 300 Bitcoin (approximately US $3.5 million) by someone who is threatening to release some 10,000 sensitive photographs of its customers.
And in an attempt to identify its blackmailer, Binance has put a 25 Bitcoin (approximately US $290,000) bounty on their head.
The content allegedly stolen from Binance purports to be know-your-customer (KYC) data uploaded by the cryptocurrency exchange’s customers when they first registered their accounts. That information includes photographs as well as passport details and IDs.
Banks and financial institutions are required to request identifying KYC data from investors in order to stem illegal activities such as fraud, money laundering and the financing of terrorist organizations.
Although not directly denying that the sensitive data is of its customers, Binance does point out how there are “inconsistencies” that suggest it may not have been stolen from the firm. Part of Binance’s reasoning is that it says it adds a watermark to images uploaded when it requests KYC data, 
thereby making it easier–if a data leak does ever occur–to identify where it might have originated: At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system. 
With that said, our security team is hard at work pursuing all possible leads in an attempt to identify the source of these images. The cryptocurrency exchange does, however, note that the images made public “all appear to be dated from February 2018, at which time Binance had contracted a 
third-party vendor for KYC verification in order to handle the high volume of requests at that time.”
The implication is clear: if these indeed are, as appears to be the case, the images of Binance users, then it may be that the unnamed third-part vendor suffered a security breach. Binance says it has sought more information from the vendor as to whether that theory might be accurate.
To perhaps underline the point that any hack may not have been specifically against Binance but instead against third-parties providing services, the cryptocurrency pointed out that the hacker “claims he has KYC information from multiple exchanges.”
According to Binance, after they turned down the extortionist’s demands, some of the “stolen data” was distributed to interested parties in the media as well as the rest of the world via a public website and Telegram group.
The chief executive of Binance, Zhao Changpeng (also known as “CZ”), turned to Twitter to discourage anyone from joining the Telegram group being used to distribute the photos: By joining or spreading the link of the Telegram group, you are helping malicious hackers (at least giving attention). 
What we should do as an industry is to fight them. Stay on the positive side. 
Report the group, then leave. It certainly hasn’t been a great year security-wise for Binance. In May, it revealed that it had suffered a security breach that saw hackers steal more than $40 million worth of Bitcoin.
And it’s not even the first time that Binance has offered a substantial reward for information that leads to the arrest of hackers. Last year, the cryptocurrency exchanges offered a reward equivalent to $250,000 as it sought to identify criminals who attempted to steal from the site after grabbing trading API keys 
from unsuspecting investors they had previously phished.
Binance says it has been in contact with law enforcement agencies about the latest incident and that it will assist the authorities with any investigation."

We have all heard about the fake sextortion email scams that tell recipients that they have installed software that records them while you are on adult web sites. After a year of these emails being sent out, many people have come to recognize them as a scam.
In a new report by released today by ESET, a new Spambot is about to make things confusing. That is because it has been discovered to record your screen while you are on porn sites or pages with keywords related to sex. A new Spambot Trojan targeting French people has been discovered 
that records a victim's screen when they are using sites related to sex, pornography, and known pornographic sites.
We have all heard about the fake sextortion email scams that tell recipients that they have installed software that records them while you are on adult web sites. After a year of these emails being sent out, many people have come to recognize them as a scam.
In a new report by released today by ESET, a new Spambot is about to make things confusing. That is because it has been discovered to record your screen while you are on porn sites or pages with keywords related to sex. In May 2019, ESET researchers observed a spike in ESET telemetry 
data regarding malware targeting France, ESET said in a new report. After further investigations, we identified malware 
that distributes various types of spam. One of them is leading to a survey that redirects to a dodgy smartphone promotion while the other is a sextortion campaign. The spam targets the users of Orange S.A., a French ISP. We notified them before the release of this publication.
The Varenyky spambot Trojan is distributed through malspam emails that pretend to be invoices or bills. These emails are worded to try and convince the user to open malicious Word attachments. When a user opens the attachment and enables its content, a Word macro will check to see if the 
language configured in Windows is French (fr-FR), and if not, will not install any malware.
On the other hand, if the computer is configured to that language, it will download the spambot and execute it.  The downloaded malware also has a language check, but this time it is looking only for the English or Russian language, and if detected, will terminate the malware with the following error. 
If the malware passes the language checks, it will now be configured to start automatically on the victim's computer.
Once running, the Trojan will connect back to it's command & control server over Tor to get instructions on what spam to send.  These spam emails target customers of the French ISP Orange telecommunications company and contain links that redirect recipients to scam sites like the ones below. 
It will also routinely connect to the malware's command & control servers over Tor where it will get commands to execute or other programs to download. According to the ESET researchers, they have seen this Trojan having the ability to execute batch files, executables, and PowerShell commands. 
Some variants will also download NirSoft’s legitimate WebBrowserPassView and Mail PassView tools in order to steal browser and email account passwords, which are then sent back to the C2. At one time the Trojan included the feature to monitor your web browser for browser window titles related 
to sex such as sexe, xxx, or webcam, or pornhub, as well as words related to bitcoin and hitler. If it detected you were browsing a web page whose title contained one of the above words, it would use a downloaded FFmpeg executable to record your screen. The recorded videos would then be sent 
back to its command & control server via a downloaded Tor client.
It is not known if these videos were being created for the attacker's curiosity or if there were plans on using it for sextortion emails against the victims.
These videos could have been used for convincing sexual blackmail; a practice called sextortion. It’s unknown if these videos were recorded out of curiosity by the author(s) of the spambot or with an intention to monetize them through sextortion.
Although the Varenyky Trojan had the ability to record these videos, ESET has seen no indication that they have been used in an actual sextortion campaign against the victim or others."

"content": "Cryptocurrencies are in the LimeLight for many years. It’s been a great topic to discuss. Many of the people are 
still not aware of what is real business of Crypto? You may have heard that people make a million dollars from the Crypto or at 
the same time, people lost thousands of dollars in this Crypto game. But who doesn’t wants fast profit? Some quick money earn! 
Many people do not understand the investing culture, never plan how to invest, and research before investing.
Well, if you are still not sure why to invest, then let me clear up some points! It’s not a bubble, because BTC raised from 750$ 
to 10,000$ in one year, people are adopting, businesses are securing payments through BTC or another Crypto. If you will not 
invest now then and you will regret later when the price goes up, and you will get missed out the chance to get some crypto for 
cheap. But before investing in any Crypto, remember the following points for sure. Be Ok With Taking Calculated Risks
There is always a risk factor in every business. If you think just Crypto is the risky investment that’s not the point, it’s entirely 
debatable. But Crypto market is highly volatile; it is not a fixed asset, because it’s a digital asset, sometimes it grows up and down. 
So do a proper calculation and invest that much, only you can afford to hold for the long term. Remember That There are Other Coins
Before few years Bitcoin is the only the king of Crypto. No other coins are near to it. Still, BTC is the king of Crypto undoubtedly. 
But there are lots of other tokens and coins, which are highly promising, and tend to give good returns. So look over other currencies 
too while you are planning to make some investments in Crypto. You can follow Tokens.net to take crypto market follow-ups.
Think About the Utility That the Coin Is Bringing Into The System
Every ICO has some business in backends. Maybe a real or virtual store, but associated. After you analyze a coin, you must check the 
white paper of the token too. A proper white paper gives all possible ideas about business, and why tokens get offered. If that white 
paper is promising, and you can see the growth, then only tends to invest your money. Exchanges must widely adopt the token you are choosing to 
invest. Sometimes for liquidity, you need to change the tokens from one to another, but some symbols don’t allow an exchange. That’s why do proper research before investing.
Conclusion
That’s all the checkpoints you need to check before planning to invest in any token. Well, if you want to be safer side, do invest in multiple coins. 
Choose proper buying and storing platform to save your Crypto."

"content": "The Winklevoss twins’ Gemini platform is being added as a constituent exchange for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group)’s cryptocurrency reference rates.
As revealed in an official tweet from CME Group on Aug. 8, Gemini will be included in four major crypto pricing indices as of Aug. 30.
CME Group Bitcoin, Ether Indices
As reported, CME Group launched its first two crypto pricing products — the standardized reference rate “CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate” and the spot index “CME CF Bitcoin Real-Time Index” — back in November 2016. 
Both were heralded as major stepping stones toward the professionalization of Bitcoin (BTC) trading and the acceptance of the asset by stalwart traditional trading giants.
In March 2018, the Group launched two analogous products for Ether (ETH): the “CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate” and “CME CF Ether Real Time Index” in partnership with United Kingdom-based crypto futures-focused exchange Crypto Facilities.
Ahead of the addition of Gemini, these pricing products drew on transactions and order book activity data from major industry trading platforms such as Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken (Coinbase is, however, not cited in relation to CME Group’s Ether products). 
Crypto index fever
CME Group was notably preceded by the New York Stock Exchange’s NYSE Bitcoin Index, which went live in May 2015 — a product that NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) claimed was the first-ever exchange-calculated and disseminated Bitcoin index.
Since these early offerings, crypto pricing products — many targeting institutional clients — have become increasingly more sophisticated and widespread. 
This June, the half a million traditional traders using the Reuters and Bloomberg financial terminals were provided with access to a new AI-powered index for the 100 strongest-performing cryptocurrencies and tokens.
London-based crypto data provider CryptoCompare launched an Exchange Benchmark product this year ranking over 100 global crypto spot exchanges worldwide, having previously announced a partnership with Nasdaq to release a new crypto pricing product, as well 
as a joint venture with BitMEX to build a crypto futures dataset.
At the end of April, Nasdaq introduced XRP Liquid Index (XRRLX) to its global data service. Nasdaq had previously begun listing Brave New Coin’s Bitcoin Liquid Index and Ethereum Liquid Index.
In March, CoinMarketCap announced the launch of two cryptocurrency benchmark indices on Nasdaq Global Index Data Service, Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon and Börse Stuttgart."

launched an official investigation, and that Chinese police will show ‘no mercy’ if a crypto scam involves a large amount of 
retail capital.
After a heavy SEC fine, founder Zack Coburn sold the platform to a group of Chinese businessmen who issued the EDT token as an exit scam.
STATE SPONSORED CRYPTO HACKING?
According to a FireEye Threat Intelligence report that emerged last week, a hacking collective called APT41 has started working alongside 
the Chinese government. The report added that the group has targeted a number of firms operating in the crypto industry. The group has also 
targeted cryptocurrencies, including at least one case in which there was a connection between cryptocurrency and an online video gaming platform. 
In October 2018, the group compiled an instance of XMRig, a Monero cryptocurrency mining tool, demonstrating a continued interest in cryptocurrency.
The dossier insinuated that there were connections with the Chinese authorities, adding that the group’s operations underscored a blurred line between 
state power and crime.
BITCOIN, A PERFECT GIFT IN CHINA
Finally, crypto whales in China have been sending BTC to each other as a display of love and affection on their version of 
Valentine’s Day. August 7 is also known as the Qixi or Qiqiao Festival celebrating the annual meeting of a cowherder and weaver 
girl in mythology. Dovey Wan has been tweeting again about the number 520 which in Chinese is pronounced similar to “I love you”.
Rich Chinese crypto whales today are busy sending the symbolic 520 $BTC to their loved ones as gift."

"content": "Just a week after the Bitcoin network notched up another new hash rate high, it has done it again and this one is a bit of a milestone.
Bitcoin Hash Rate Hits 80 EH/s
For the first time ever, Bitcoin’s hash rate has topped 80 Exahashes per second. According to Bitinfocharts.com network hash rate hit 80.249 EH/s yesterday. 
The latest milestone has not gone unnoticed on crypto twitter. In simple terms the hash rate is the speed at which computers on the Bitcoin network operate. 
The higher the number, the better it is for miners, as the chances of completing the mathematical problem to solve the block and collect the resultant block reward is increased. 
These measurement records the number of hashes per second Bitcoin miners are performing on the network. As a parody against rival blockchains which have forked off from Bitcoin, 
some have been comparing the two hash rates. Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV are both light years behind in contrast. Even RT anchor Max Keiser has noticed the significance of this computing milestone, tweeting ‘Hashrate leads price. 80 Quintillion high means we’re on track.’
Network strength is a bullish sign of market health and several of these measurements, including volume are now higher than they were during the price peak in late 2017. BTC can cope with growth better and other aspects such as block reward halving in May next year can only add to the sentiment.
BTC Transactions and Price Holding Steady
Another measurement of adoption and growth is daily transactions on the Bitcoin network. At the moment there are around 370k transactions per day. The all-time high came during Bitcoin’s price peak in mid-December 2017 when it hit 490k. The most recent high was in early May this year when daily transactions topped 450k.
BTC price was also holding fast at the time of writing. After crossing the $12k barrier twice in the past 24 hours, Bitcoin had retreated slightly to the $11,800 region at the time of writing, leaving it relatively flat on the day. Since the same time last Thursday, BTC has gained around 18 percent.
A couple of longer term technical indicators have turned bullish recently such as Bloomberg’s favoured GTI VERA Convergence Divergence Indicator. This measure of positive or negative trends has flashed a ‘buy’ signal recently according to the outlet.
Additionally a golden cross formed on the four hour chart yesterday. When the 50 moving average crosses the slower 200 MA, it is a sign of strengthening uptrend which is likely to lead to further gains in the respective time frame."

"content": "The rise of bitcoin and the imminent release of Facebook’s Libra has taken cryptocurrency — a mere idea a decade 
ago — mainstream. As these new payment and money management methods gain momentum among financial institutions and their customers, 
hackers have leveraged security vulnerabilities to exploit this new financial landscape.
Of particular concern is the stealthy yet devastating threat of cryptojacking. In this threat case, hackers infiltrate a computer to 
mine cryptocurrency. They do this either by getting the victim to click on a malicious link in an email that loads cryptomining code 
onto the computer (an approach called phishing) or by infecting a website or online ad with JavaScript code that auto-executes once 
loaded in the victim’s browser.
For businesses that want to participate in the digital revolution driving cryptocurrencies but still want to protect against bad actors, 
understanding cryptocurrency is key, as is implementing a security strategy that safeguards against its weakest spots. 
MORE FROM BIZTECH: Update your cybersecurity response plan before an attack occurs.
Why Cryptocurrency Is the Next Big Security Threat
The most well-known form of cryptocurrency is bitcoin, but several other kinds such as Litecoin, Ethereum and Zcash were designed to compete with bitcoin. 
This financial market is purely digital; no physical coins exist.
Instead, cryptocurrencies use a technology called blockchain, which “is essentially a database that contains a record of all of the transactions that have 
taken place on it,” Lifewire explains. Blockchain has no centralized network location, making it harder to be hacked. While the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem is 
protected by this decentralization, an individual user’s computer isn’t.
Hackers break into a cryptocurrency user’s computer using either phishing scams or malware, then access any wallets containing digital currency. Then, much like a 
robber will drain a bank vault, the hacker “steals” these digital coins. Poor endpoint or device security — a smartphone without a password, a computer on a public network, 
an email with a sketchy link — make cryptocurrency accounts particularly vulnerable to these kinds of attack. Poor storage hygiene — unprotected public clouds, open servers — 
can also open up wallets to hackers. How to Protect Against Cryptojacking
According to the Internet Society’s Online Trust Alliance “Cyber Incident and Breach Trends Report,” financial losses from cryptojacking incidents more than tripled from 2017 to 2018.
The report also found that 95 percent of data breaches were preventable through following “simple and common-sense approaches to improving security,” such as improved data security and privacy. 
When it comes to cryptocurrency, that means understanding how to mitigate risk.
According to Lifewire, there are three key steps to protecting cryptocurrency from bad actors:
The best prevention against being hacked is a combination of hardware and personal habit. Put coin wallet databases on a detachable 
hard drive or a USB stick that detaches from the computer or network where currency is being accumulated. Then, transfer the coins 
from their online storage into a detachable wallet so they do not accumulate online.
Follow a personal habit of backing up wallets every two days, keep passwords written down in a safe place and keep a personal wallet 
on a home computer to lower the risk of losing a wallet.
Find a reputable mining pool where the members are active in a forum and keep each other honest by keeping constant eyes on the pool 
operations."

Pal’s premise is that the dollar’s value is about to explode higher. But in doing so, almost every other currency on the planet will plunge off a cliff, creating a global currency crisis.
To back his theory, he posts 10 different currency charts on the brink of historical breaking points. Crucially, he says, we are at the “CLIFF OF DEATH” for the ADXY - an index of Asian 
currencies on the brink of falling 20% against the dollar. Pal then cycles through the currency charts outside Asia. The British pound moving close to parity with the dollar. The Australian 
and New Zealand dollars breaking lower. The Canadian dollar and euro inching closer to currency crisis levels.
As all major global currencies fall against the dollar, Pal expects “an enormous deflationary wave.” As the Financial Times explains: '[Deflationary waves] start in the foreign exchange 
markets before making their way through others: commodities, debt, equity and finally the real economy.' We’re already seeing the pressure hit commodities markets. Within an hour of Pal’s tweet, 
the oil price tanked. WHY BITCOIN MATTERS IN THIS CRISIS
Pal ends his assessment with five words: 'Bonds. Dollars. Bitcoin and Gold.' As he explains, gold is “rightly doing its job, sniffing 
out a BIG problem and exploding higher.” If his currency crisis theory is right, gold will offer a safe haven as global currencies fall. Bitcoin also has a role to play. 
Pal goes into detail: 'Bitcoin is doing its job of suggesting an alternative system is gaining in probability.' As CCN reported, we’ve seen bitcoin pop over the last week in broad correlation 
with China’s move to devalue its yuan currency. Although the data isn’t conclusive, there’s some reason to believe capital flight out of Asian currencies could be moving into bitcoin.
The narrative of bitcoin becoming a ‘safe haven” is building traction, even in traditional financial outlets. It might be a self-fulfilling prophecy, but the looming currency crisis will truly 
put this theory to the test."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-08T12:36:34Z",
"content": "FRAMINGHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Worldwide spending on blockchain solutions is forecast to be nearly $15.9 billion 
in 2023, according to a new update to the Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide from International Data Corporation (IDC). 
IDC expects blockchain spending to grow at a robust pace throughout the 2018-2023 forecast period with a five-year compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 60.2%. Blockchain spending in 2019 is forecast to be $2.7 billion, an increase of 80% over 2018. Behind the 
sometimes heated public discussions and debates over blockchain, enterprise adoption of the technology has quietly reached a tipping 
point across multiple use cases. Companies are recognizing value from initial pilot programs and moving those projects into production, 
said James Wester, research director, Worldwide Blockchain Strategies. As the data in the Spending Guide indicates, the growth and adoption 
of blockchain by enterprises is accelerating as the benefits of using blockchain to increase efficiency and improve processes are understood. 
There is certainly some uncertainty still regarding the technology, specifically in the areas of governance and regulation, but adoption of 
blockchain for financial services, identity, trade, and other markets is encouraging.
Global blockchain spending will be led by the banking industry, which will account for roughly 30% of the worldwide total throughout 
the forecast. Discrete manufacturing and process manufacturing will be the next largest industries with a combined share of more than 20% of 
overall spending. Process manufacturing will also have the fastest spending growth (68.8% CAGR), enabling it to become the second largest 
industry for blockchain spending by the end of the forecast period. Four other industries (discrete manufacturing, professional services, 
retail, and utilities) will also grow faster than the overall market.
The banking industry will also drive spending on two of the largest blockchain use cases – cross border payments & settlements and trade 
finance & post-trade/transaction settlements. Spending on lot lineage/provenance and asset/goods management use cases will be led by steady 
investments from the discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing, and retail industries. All the use cases identified by IDC will see 
strong spending growth over the forecast period with CAGRs within a few percentage points of the overall market.
From a technology perspective, IT services and business services (combined) will account for nearly 70% of all blockchain spending in 2019 
with IT services receiving slightly more investment over the forecast period. Blockchain platform software will be the largest category of 
spending outside of the services segment and the second fastest growing technology category overall with a five-year CAGR of 65.2%, following 
IT services with a CAGR of 66.0%.
Spending on blockchain solutions in the United States will be nearly $1.1 billion in 2019, making it the largest geographic market, followed 
by Western Europe ($661 million) and China ($304 million). All nine regions covered in the spending guide will see phenomenal spending growth 
over the 2018-2023 forecast period led by Canada with five-year CAGR of 73.3%.
While the debate continues as to whether cryptocurrencies are a solution in search of a problem, many organizations and enterprises have 
realized that blockchain solves many current and impending business problems. Many blockchain projects are gaining steam as players across
the value chain realize the significant progress blockchain brings, launching much-needed transformation within and across industries and use cases, 
said Stacey Soohoo, research manager, Customer Insights & Analysis. With enterprises moving past the proof-of-concept phase, it's not a matter of 
whether blockchain is here to stay but rather the scope of blockchain's adoption. Sharing data between institutions, simplifying outdated processes, 
and bringing transparency to business processes while also encouraging collaboration and partnerships – these are the tangible benefits that blockchain 
brings to the table.
The Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide quantifies the emerging blockchain market by providing spending data for ten technologies 
across 19 industries and 17 use cases in nine geographic regions. IDC defines blockchain as a digital, distributed ledger of transactions or records. 
The ledger, which stores the information or data, exists across multiple participants in a peer-to-peer network. There is no single, central repository 
that stores the ledger. Distributed ledgers technology (DLT) allows new transactions to be added to an existing chain of transactions using a secure, 
digital or cryptographic signature. Spending associated with various cryptocurrencies that utilize blockchain and distributed ledgers technology, 
such as Bitcoin, is not included in the spending guide. Unlike any other research in the industry, the comprehensive spending guide was designed 
to help IT decision makers to clearly understand the industry-specific scope and direction of blockchain spending today and over the next five years."

"content": "PHOENIX, Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- IDX Insights, a research & development firm, announces the launch of the first 
investable factor crypto currency index, which is now available on SMArtX Advisory Solutions' managed accounts platform. The IDX 
Crypto Opportunity Index (COIN), is designed to opportunistically allocate between cryptocurrencies and fixed income ETFs to by 
exploiting short-term momentum. The index seeks to provide a risk-managed allocation option for investors who seek to use robust 
factor techniques to harvest attractive risk-adjusted returns from a volatile asset class. Ben McMillan, founding partner and CIO 
of IDX Insights said, As crypto-assets have emerged as an alternative asset class, we continued to question how to prudently deploy 
risk- capital in the space.  While several long-only crypto-currency indexes exist, there were none that took a tactical approach to 
deploying risk-capital when the risk/return profiles look most favorable. Nascent asset classes often provide an opportunity for 
substantial returns but come with elevated volatility and considerable drawdowns; and bitcoin (and the other cryptocurrencies) have 
been no different. We've seen increased investor interest in the space but believe that a long-only approach simply doesn't make sense 
for most investors.
Evan Rappaport, founder and CEO of SMArtX Advisory Solutions said, We have been seeing increased demand from Advisors who want to 
provide clients exposure to cryptocurrency but have been unable to do so due to the lack of custodial options and inherent volatility 
associated with the asset class. The IDX Crypto Opportunity Index can help to solve both of these issues. SMArtX was first to offer 
long/short strategies to advisors in a UMA structure and is proud to work with IDX to offer pioneering Crypto strategies to the advisor 
marketplace.
With the prospect of economic and political uncertainty as well as historically low forward-looking real returns, investors are seeking 
strategies that can provide attractive returns - on both an absolute and risk-adjusted basis – and that are uncorrelated to global equity 
markets. The IDX Crypto Opportunity Index seeks to provide investors with access to an emerging, high opportunity asset class by harvesting 
attractive risk-adjusted returns by using proven, robust factor techniques.
The IDX Crypto Opportunity Index joins 16 other IDX indices currently available on the SMArtX Advisory Solutions platform. The existing 
indexes cover a wide range of investment strategies including fixed income, commodity, sector, and factor-based solutions.

"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T21:10:00Z",
"content": "The Department of Energy is putting down its guns and withdrawing troops in the war on the incandescent bulb that began in 2007. It’s pretty late in the day; the last factory to make them in the U.S. shut down in 2010. It’s hard to find them in a store, in which case: thank goodness for Amazon! 
Still, the damage can be reversed. Our houses can again be warm and beautiful, and legally. You can turn on the lights in the morning and not have your eyes lacerated by blindingly fake electric “light.” As the Wall Street Journal summed up the current moment: “If you like old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs, you can keep buying them.”As a huge fan of Ayn Rand’s short novel Anthem, the liberation of the light bulb means so much to me. It was published in 1937 but mostly drafted in the 1920s in Russia. In the dystopian story, a cruel government committee comes down hard on a young man who has re-discovered the light bulb. They condemn him for daring to think for himself and presuming to override the planned poverty of the social order. This society ruled by the total state is perfectly happy with its candles, and desires that no steps forward can be taken that are not explicitly approved by the ruling class.
Ayn Rand used the example of the light bulb because it is such a great symbol of the power of the human mind. It is within our power to harness the energy that comes from the heavens. “The power of the sky can be made to do men’s bidding,” observes the Anthem protagonist. “There are no limits to its secrets and its might, and it can be made to grant us anything if we but choose to ask.”
As Murray Rothbard observed, riffing on Rand’s insight, the light bulb finally freed humanity from having to defer to the earth’s rotations to determine work hours. It allowed night baseball, made our highways safer, and put civilization on a 24/7 basis. The light bulb means much more than what it is in its physical essence. It was the dawn of humankind’s mastery of the world.
A few years ago, I was contemplating Rand’s novel and looked up at my ceiling fan. Three glorious incandescent bulbs were lighting up the room in a warm glow. These particular bulbs lacked blue and white frosting. The glass was clear and the curved filament burned like a miniature flame. And yet that flame is caged and is made to be a servant of human dreams and aspirations. The deeper story is about a thoroughly insidious attempt by bureaucracies together with a gaggle of politicians to ban the light bulb as we’ve always known it. In other words, it’s the plot of Anthem lived in real time. 
It all began with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which called for a phaseout of the incandescent bulb by 2012 (variously amended by Congress to push out the deadline). The law banned light bulbs by wattage but not by name. In practice, it meant death for the kind of light we’ve enjoyed since the 19th century.
Gone from the shelves were the incandescent bulbs of 100 watts. Then it got worse as 40- and 60-watt incandescent light bulbs were killed off. Factories that once produced them were shut. 
Once you dig more deeply, you find something remarkable: there was no scientific basis for this ban at all. Consider the ten-years ago analysis of Howard Brandston, a fellow of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America and the brains behind the refurbishment of the Statue of Liberty in the 1980s.
Brandston argued that the government’s metric of lumens-per-watt was completely bogus. It doesn’t consider the quality of light for a room. It doesn’t consider the costs of making replacements or the environmental danger of more “efficient” bulbs (fluorescent bulbs contain mercury), and doesn’t consider the whole reason we have lightbulbs to begin with: to light up a space. It focuses on one narrow point at the expense of all these broader considerations. “The calculations used by the government and others promulgating or promoting the use of compact fluorescents,” he said, “is strictly mathematical conjecture and has nothing to do with reality.” That rings true to me. So how can the consumer tell which are the best bulbs? Brandston says that a person’s subjective judgment, tempered by a consideration of how long bulbs last, is more than enough. You don’t need bureaucracies and you don’t need experts.
But even if the new bulbs are awful, don’t they save energy? Brandston said: “hoping that lighting is going to make a major contribution borders on ridiculous. …We’d be better off promoting occupancy sensors and dimming controls and recommending all dimmers be set to only provide 95 percent of the power to the light sources.” Why did the government do this to us? It fits with everything else about federal policy for the last 60 years. It seems to have put the goal of increasing human misery as a main policy goal. This is why our toilets, faucets, detergent, and washers have been wrecked with water-use controls–even though none of these policies make a significant difference in overall water usage. Just look at what government has done to our bathrooms. 
It’s why we are pushed to recycle even though no one has ever demonstrated that the mandates help the environment. It’s why we are taxed on things we want to do like drive cars. It’s why we can no longer medicate ourselves in normal ways without a doctor’s permission. It’s why we must endure hectoring lectures from public officials about fast food, sweets, and our trash generation.
What do all these policies have in common? They target things that we enjoy and that make our life better, then force on us inferior products and services. It’s the penance we must do in the interest of the common good — and never mind whether the common good is actually enhanced in real life.
Which gets us back to Ayn Rand and the light bulb. She had a prophetic way of seeing the truth about government. She grew up under a regime that promised heaven on earth but ended up making a hell for everyone not part of the ruling class. She saw that governments could not produce imaginative goods and would eventually fall back on celebrating the poverty and destruction they cause — and inventing an ethic of sacrifice for the whole as a means of covering up their crimes. If you don’t go along, you are an enemy of the people.
It’s rather incredible that we have come full circle. Just as in Anthem, the U.S. government actually almost banned the light bulb as we’ve known it. Just think about the awesome implications of that and ask yourself why we put up with it.
On a personal note, my own dear mother replaced all her incandescents with fluorescents several years ago. I was sitting in her house feeling vaguely irritated by the searing lights in the room—cold and dreary—and had to turn them off.
Sitting in the dimly lit room, my thought was: This is what the government has done to us. A great invention from the dawn of modernity is being driven out of use. Do I have to bring my own candles next holiday season?
Why should governments be in the position of deciding what technologies can and cannot be used, as if consumers are too stupid to make such decisions for themselves? Who is to decide what is efficient, and what the proper tradeoff should be between the energy expended and the light produced? More fundamentally, why should governments be in the business of picking right and wrong technologies at all?
There is a grave cost to regulation and it’s not just about freedom itself. It’s about experimentation and innovation. A vast regulatory apparatus on cell phone technology in 1990 could never have imagined something like a modern smartphone. Regulations on digital commerce in 2000 might have stopped the rise of peer-to-peer services like Uber. Bitcoin is another example of a technology that blasted through the nationalization of money to show us something entirely new. 
Indeed, one of the reasons that the digital world was so innovative until a few years ago was precisely because the regulators were not yet caught up with the pace of innovation. That’s probably changing with the new antitrust push. 
Regulations on technology freeze the status quo in place and make it permanent. In government, a ban is a ban, something to be enforced, not tweaked according to new discoveries and approaches. Regulatory interventions stop the progress of history by disabling the limitless possibilities of the human imagination.
We live in times without much good news in politics. Let’s at least take the weekend to celebrate the embrace of progress, acquiescence to the wisdom of markets, the new freedom found for this hugely important symbol of humankind’s triumph over the poverty of nature."

"content": "Another week, another of Crypto Tidbits. At long last, the Bitcoin price saw some bullish action this week, gaining some 10% over the past seven days according to Coin360.io. While BTC is trading 4% lower from its weekly highs, analysts are starting to believe that the trend for the cryptocurrency market is finally pointing upward again, with the 35% correction seen in July and August seemingly having ended.
The fundamentals support the idea that the “bull is back on”, with there being a smattering of positive crypto and blockchain developments observed over the past week. They, along with some not so positive news events, are as follows.
Bitcoin & Crypto Tidbits: Bakkt Starts to Custody Bitcoin Ahead of Futures Launch: This week, Bakkt finally launched its Bitcoin custody product, giving institutions a way to securely store their BTC via the new platform. “Today our Warehouse opens for customer bitcoin deposits and withdrawals as we prepare for the Bakkt Bitcoin Daily & Monthly Futures, launching September 23. The availability of physical delivery brings more flexibility in managing bitcoin exposure,” the platform announced in a recent tweet.
Ethereum Istanbul Testnet Integration Pushed Back: Sorry Ethereum fans, Istanbul hasn’t happened yet. The upgrade (or at least the testnet iteration), which is expected to bring the popular blockchain a number of improvements and changes, was recently pushed back by the core developer team. According to CoinDesk, Hudson Jameson, a community manager at the Ethereum Foundation, told developers in a call on Friday that Istanbul’s testnet activation date will be pushed to October 2nd from the original tentative September 4th date. According to the developers, the later date is due to an influx of Ethereum Improvement Protocols submitted for review for the upgrade.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell Drops Comment on Crypto: In a meeting in Switzerland sponsored by the Swiss Institute of International Studies, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell touched on the topic of cryptocurrency. He stated, presumably in response to moves from China to launch a digital currency of its own, that his organization is not “actively considering” its own cryptocurrency. Powell then touched on Libra, remarking that the Facebook-backed project has the ability to become “systematically important very quickly.” Powell didn’t touch on the regulation of Bitcoin.
VanEck Launches Institutional-Centric Bitcoin Product: On Tuesday, VanEck Securities Corp. and SolidX Management LLC, two pro-crypto firms that are behind a leading Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application, revealed that they were going to be proactive, launching a workaround product. According to Bloomberg, they said that by utilizing a certain rule of a historical securities act, the duo would be able to issue shares in the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust to qualified institutional investors. VanEck’s head of ETF product, Ed Lopez, is hopeful that institutional demand for Bitcoin will materialize in demand for this new “clear” product.
China Confirms ‘Deets’ About Centralized Crypto: Speaking of central banks, an official of the People’s Bank of China purportedly stated that the new centralized crypto will be supported across major e-payments platforms, including WeChat Pay and Alipay. Mu Changchun added that the tokens are effectively digital versions of the yuan.
Social Media Giant Telegram Continues Blockchain Launch: Social media giant Telegram continues to roll out its own blockchain. The firm recently released the code for running a node for the blockchain, dubbed the Telegram Open Network (TON). Developers can begin launching full nodes, validator nodes, and blockchain explorers for the product, according to a report from CoinDesk.
Samsung Launches a Crypto-Centric Iteration of Galaxy Note 10: According to a Wall Street Journal Article published Thursday, South Korean technology behemoth Samsung is launching an iteration of its flagship smartphone — the Galaxy Note 10 — centered around crypto and blockchain. Dubbed the “KlaytnPhone”, a name attributed to the device in reference to social media firm Kakao’s blockchain, the Samsung phone will purportedly only be sold in South Korea. It, the report states, is effectively identical to the stock Note 10. But, it will sport a pre-installed crypto wallet and certain blockchain applications. Also, owners of the device will purportedly be sent some of the Klay cryptocurrency (too bad it’s not Bitcoin, eh?), the currency of Klaytn.
Binance Launches USD-Backed Stablecoin: This week, Binance revealed that it would be launching its own flagship stablecoin, Binance USD (BUSD), which is slated to be pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. For now, the stablecoin will be built on Ethereum and will be created by Binance in collaboration with Paxos. The duo claims that they have received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), making BUSD available for New York investors.
Apple Sees Potential in Cryptocurrency, Yet Unlikely to Take the Plunge Yet: Speaking to CNN, Apple finds cryptocurrency “interesting” — whatever that means. Jennifer Bailey, vice president at Apple Pay, explained in an interview that the topic has “interesting long-term potential”, but added that right now, Apple’s digital payments ecosystem is only focused on “what consumers are using today”. While this statement was short and seemingly forcefully nebulous, Bailey seems to be hinting that should digital assets gain enough traction, Apple may delve into the crypto game.
PWC’s Luxembourg Branch Now Accepts BTC: On Monday, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) — one of the “Big Four” companies — revealed that one of its regional divisions, Luxembourg, will be accepting payments made in Bitcoin, marking a small yet positive step forward in the adoption cycle of cryptocurrency."

Here is the past week of crypto and blockchain news in review, as originally reported by Cointelegraph auf Deutsch.
German government explains proposed regulations for crypto wallets and exchanges
Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reported on Sept. 3, that, in reply to a request by the Free Democratic Party, the German Federal Government announced further details on planned regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. The government states that crypto firms will be subject to regulatory requirements under the country’s banking act.
German regulator bans trading platform from offering contracts for difference
The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has asked Ivory Group Limited, which is the operator of trading platform TradeToro.com, to stop cross-border trading in contracts for differences (CFDs) on currency pairs and cryptocurrencies. Per the regulator, the firm did not have the necessary licenses to conduct business in CFDs. 
Swiss canton of Schwyz intends to become a new blockchain hub
The Swiss canton of Schwyz, together with service provider Blockchain Propulsion, intends to become a new blockchain hub, much like the Crypto Valley in Zug. A newly founded Propulsion Hub in the canton aims to support the blockchain ecosystem in Switzerland.
Blockchain Propulsion opened its doors in in Pfäffikon, which is the economic center of the canton of Schwyz with the lowest tax burden for companies and individuals.
Crypto-scammers use Austrian news anchors as bait
Crypto-fraudsters are reportedly using fake online ads with well-known personalities to lure potential victims into cryptocurrency scams. The scams provide links to purported investment schemes and binary options scams. 
Austrian news anchor Armin Wolf took to Twitter to describe the investment recommendations using his name as fake and a real mess. Wolf tweeted, “I do not advertise (would also be prohibited by the ORF law). And I give no investment tips, neither for bitcoins nor for other extremely speculative (or other) investments.”
IOTA Foundation publishes perspective on smart cities
On Sept. 5, the IOTA Foundation — a non-profit organization for blockchain development — published its 19-page study Towards Open & Transparent Cities which shares IOTA’s perspectives on the current concepts for smart city projects and the future challenges in which IOTA could play a major role.
IOTA states that a range of nascent technologies like distributed ledgers, artificial intelligence and the internet of things will improve municipal operations in transportation, lighting systems, waste management and other areas.
Currently IOTA is collaborating with Taiwan's capital Taipei and with the European Commission-sponsored CityxChange project to further study the idea of smart cities."

"content": "Critics have been trying to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt on the No. 2 cryptocurrency in light of its scaling issues. It’s true that Ethereum is struggling with congestion as network utilization is above 94 percent. As a result, it becomes costly to run applications.
Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency’s biggest problem appears to be its source of strength. The network is congested because there are so many developers building decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain. In addition, the scaling issue is temporary, as the Ethereum community has a solution with a timeline in place.
Ethereum Dominates All Cryptocurrencies in Number of Developers
When it comes to the number of developers working on an ecosystem, Ethereum is king of the hill. It is so overwhelmingly dominant in this regard that the runner up is so far behind. According to a recent study by Electric Capital, there are 1,156 monthly average developers. That number is four times greater than the next biggest ecosystem, which is Bitcoin. The study also noted that other ecosystems and crypto networks have fewer than 250 developers.
This metric is so important because the cryptocurrency with the highest number of developers is likely the one that has the most value.
Ethereum Leads All Platforms in Total DApps
Another reason why the Ethereum network utilization is sky high is that it leads all blockchains in total DApps and daily active users. DApp usage has been steadily growing that it’s no wonder that the network is congested. This issue won’t last though, as the Ethereum community is working towards a solution.
Introduction of Sharding in Early 2020
The Ethereum ecosystem plans to eliminate its scalability issue with a long-term solution in sharding. Simply put, sharding breaks up the blockchain into smaller segments. This will lead to a significant uptick in transaction speed.
According to an Ethereum Foundation call, sharding will be launched by January 2020. Hence, we’re a few months away from a monumental development in the Ethereum network. Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Streets, spoke to CCN and shared his stance on the coin. The Texas West Capital trader said: “Price has found support in the green demand zone and is presently working towards breaking descending (dashed) resistance. A move through that line would indicate likely further price appreciation.” Disclaimer: The views expressed in this op-ed are solely those of the author and do not represent those of, nor should they be attributed to, CCN Markets."

"content": "Bitcoin’s recent surge up to highs of over $10,800 drastically shifted the overall market sentiment and had led many investors and analysts alike to believe that BTC was highly likely to move past $11,000.
BTC’s subsequent drop from these levels, however, invalidated this perceived bullishness, and now a prominent analyst is explaining that Bitcoin is currently trading within a bearish descending triangle on a macro time frame, which may mean that another drop is imminent.
Bitcoin Plummets 4%, But Finds Stability Around $10,400 
At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading down nearly 4% at its current price of $10,450, which marks a significant drop from its 24-hour highs of just below $11,000 that were set yesterday.
Yesterday’s rejection marks the second time in the past week that it was rejected in the upper-$10,000 region, which may signal that this is an insurmountable resistance level that could send it reeling significantly lower in the near-future. Chonis Trading, a popular crypto analyst on Twitter, explained in a recent tweet that Bitcoin’s daily close yesterday marked a strong rejection of the upper-$10,000 region, which may spell trouble for it in the near-future.
“$BTC – daily candle closed with a strong rejection of intraday highs…Middle BB held support when tested…FIB retrace currently at 38.2%,” he noted while pointing to the below chart. Will a Massive Descending Triangle Force BTC Lower?: In recent times many analysts have been pointing to a large triangle formation on Bitcoin’s macro-price chart as one potential catalyst for another massive upwards movement in the near-future, but now one analyst is noting that this triangle is actually a bearish formation. Peter Brandt spoke about this in a recent tweet, explaining that although he is currently long on Bitcoin, it’s currently trading within a descending triangle, which typically results in a downwards break.
“Bitcoin meets the definition of a descending triangle. Don’t let newbie chartists tell you different. Right-angled triangles imply (but do not demand) a resolution thru the horizontal boundary,” he noted. Assuming that this triangle is the main impetus that leads Bitcoin’s price action in one direction or another, investors and analysts alike will soon know whether or not it is ready to journey upwards, or if significantly further losses are imminent."

"content": "As Bitcoin continues to put distance between itself and the altcoin market, three ‘major’ altcoins have completed their capitulations to more than, or close to, 2 year lows.
In effect, the previous two years hype, price-pumps and progress have been wiped out over the course of a summer. Most losses were incurred in 2018, but only in the past couple of months has it become apparent that the altcoin market isn’t ready to mindlessly surge again any time soon. 
Bytecoin (BCN):
On Friday, September 6th the dollar value of Bytecoin (BCN) fell to a 28-month low. The last time BCN was priced at $0.000443 was May 15th, 2017. If you believe in the concept of historic support prices, then it may interest you to know that BCN was priced at one tenth that value just weeks earlier. In other words, any further decreases could be just as sudden and unexpected as its increases were back in 2017. 
Stellar (XLM): 
Stellar struck a new 22-month low on Friday when it dropped to $0.058315 – a price point not seen since November 28th. As with Bytecoin, Stellar only spent a matter of minutes at the $0.05 range back in 2017, such was the strength of the explosive altcoin surge. Just two weeks prior XLM was priced at $0.02, and two weeks later it was priced at $0.30 – a 1,400% increase.
If we assume a full reversion to the price prior to 2017’s surge, that would mean Stellar is headed for a sub-one cent price point. 
Zcash (ZEC): 
Zcash was last priced at $44.31 on March 15th, 2017 – almost 30 months ago. The BTC price of 416,312 satoshis (0.00416312 BTC) has never been recorded before, and continues to plumb new depths. The only obvious upside for Zcash is that unlike Ethereum, Litecoin etc., ZEC is just 50% drop away from its all-time dollar low. With a 50% drop easily foreseeable by the end of 2019, the Zcash’s historic price supports will truly be put to the test.
What’s Next for Altcoins?: 
The fates of those three altcoins appear sealed for the immediate future, but what happens beyond that is anyone’s guess. We’ve seen before that some cryptocurrencies need to maintain a certain price point or else risk facing complete liquidation. Others face the prospect of dying out through lack of activity.
With other altcoins like Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin still holding on to some of their 2019 values, the question now is how far will they fall. The market has discriminated so far, and holders of these coins should be hoping that it continues to do so.

"content": "Over the past few months, a trade war has been raging between the U.S. and China. Throughout this, Bitcoin (BTC) has managed to post stellar gains, rallying by some 100% since the latest leg of this dispute began.
While many believe that this is nothing but a coincidence, data is starting to show that the trade war has had a substantial effect on Bitcoin’s dynamic.
Bitcoin Trading at Record Inverse Correlation With Yuan:
Bloomberg has reported that the 30-day inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the yuan has reached a record low, implying that the trade war has forced Chinese investors to adopt BTC. Speaking to Bloomberg, Dr. Garrick Hileman, the head of Blockchain.com’s research division, explained that this can be verified by the fact that “people in Asia were paying more for Bitcoin than elsewhere when the yuan fell”, looking to certain premiums on platforms like Huobi. Of course, there were some occasions where a negative premium (a discount, to be accurate) was observed in China. Yet Hileman asserts that the negative correlation has much to do with the trade war.
If he’s correct, the negative correlation corroborates the whole idea that Bitcoin is a form of “digital gold”, in that it has similar characteristics and price patterns to the precious metal, yet it exists in a digital setting.
Not a Safe Haven?:
Despite the growing correlation, some have been quick to deny that Bitcoin is acting as a safe haven in the raging trade spat.
In a tweet published in the wake of a recent surge in BTC and simultaneous collapse in the Yuan, Peter Schiff wrote that the recent rally isn’t a sign that the cryptocurrency is a beneficiary of “safe haven buying [that is] similar to gold”. Instead, the gold proponent argued that Bitcoin is being bought up by “speculators” betting that investors are searching for a store of value. This comes shortly after he claimed that Bitcoin’s inability to maintain gains in this tumultuous macroeconomic environment is a sign that it has “failed the safe haven test”. As reported by NewsBTC at the time, the fact that Bitcoin failed to hold its gains during a trade war development doesn’t bode well for advocates of BTC being digital gold.

Of course, the high volume of Tether (USDT) trades — which are widely believed to be completed by Chinese traders — tells a different story. But Schiff has been quite staunch in his belief."

"urlToImage": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fortnite-android-9.jpg?w=1200&strip=all",
"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T17:25:11Z",
"content": "The game industry has long been a target for cybercriminals, and so it was no surprise in the past couple weeks to see the discovery of ransomware that attacks the accounts of Fortnite players.
Cybersecurity firm Cyren found a free game hack tool, Syrk, that players download as a way to cheat in the game. But they discover it disables malware defenses and then deletes batches of the users’ files and encrypts them. To un-encrypt them, the player has to pay to receive a password. Akamai also noted that there is a big rise in credential stuffing attacks, where criminals use stolen identities in automated attacks that use brute force to break into accounts. From November 2017 to March 31, 2019, Akamai found 55 billion credential stuffing attacks. Gaming sites saw 12 billion of those attacks. No organization or gamer is immune.
Gaming is a target because that’s where the money is today. I recently spoke about this with Nelson Rodriguez, global director of media industry strategy at Akamai.
Here’s an edited transcript of our interview.
GamesBeat: Can you tell me more about what you’re doing?:
Nelson Rodriguez: Talking about the Fortnite scams, I think the key for us to talk about this is that we see it as very much a hygiene story. It’s a security hygiene story. It’s not like there’s much that Epic can do directly about it, or much that Akamai would be doing to prevent it from the perspective of a game, someone installing the wrong kind of software in their computer. I do think, though, that for us this raises the broader issue of what the popularity of games is creating in terms of security risk.
You might remember from 10 or 15 years ago, the way folks got access to your computer was often through things like fake security scares or fake security software. Now games are such a rich way in. Players have such an incentive to try to maximize their experience with a game. Really, free-to-play is driving it more than anything. When it was a premium game, premium games didn’t have the mechanics that would encourage you to install some external piece of software to maximize your experience. But for free-to-play games, the way they’re built and designed, they lend themselves to manipulation, or at least the desire for players to have some kind of advantage.
That’s relevant to us, what the popularity of games is doing to drive those kinds of threats. We think there is technology that all consumers and all companies should have in place on their computers, to prevent bad software from being installed, and to monitor the way your software is operating and behaving. Data exfiltration, that’s something that is relevant for us. But more than anything, game companies need to look at these trends to see — sure, it wasn’t your game that created this problem, but the popularity of your game is creating this dynamic where players want to go out and gain advantage outside of the game. It’s something everyone has to pay attention to. GamesBeat: Did Akamai take a look at some data here as well, related to the Fortnite ransomware scams?
Rodriguez: Our security team took a look to see what the nature of this threat is. We recognized it had nothing to do with the game. It looks a lot like typical ransomware. We look at it not from a statistics point of view, but a technology point of view. There is a stat angle, where game companies are the most attacked companies in the world, more attacked than defense contractors or financial services companies. Gaming companies are a really rich attack surface. That we know from a statistics point of view.
From a technology point of view, we recognize that this particular exploit looks a lot like any other data exfiltration exploit. If you can get someone — think of it as a classic phishing scam. If somebody can get you to click on something because you think it’s going to do one thing and it ends up on your machine and does something else, we understand that technology.
It’s preventable, particularly in a proper network environment where the network is monitoring — let me step back a second. A lot of what we think about security is outside in. Building a wall — this gets to the concept of zero trust. The historical model is, you build a wall and you make sure nobody can get inside the wall. The trick to that technique is, as soon as somebody gets inside the wall, they have full access to everything.
One of the steps to having a zero trust approach to security — first of all, don’t assume the wall is going to protect everyone. Get away from this model of a wall. There is no such thing as a wall. Yes, you have access controls, but don’t assume that those controls will be foolproof. The next thing you have to do is evaluate inside out. Not just what’s trying to get in, but what’s trying to get out. That’s where a lot of these kinds of scams get revealed — if you monitor what is asking for access outside your computer that you didn’t drive, that wasn’t driven by the user. Not just what’s trying to get in, but what’s trying to get out.
It’s like those classic horror movies. The killer is inside the house. That’s the thing. It’s not just what’s trying to break in from the outside, but what’s already inside your machine that’s trying to exfiltrate data. From a technical point of view, that’s what’s most interesting about this. Also, it just highlights the fact that having any trust in a login or authentication system is just old-fashioned. Nowadays you have to assume that no machine is safe. You have to be managing security at a machine level with a perspective toward — assume that if someone is logged in, they might already be infected. What are they pulling out? What’s leaving the machine or leaving the network?
GamesBeat: Just on the basics, what did we have happen here? We had Fortnite accounts where players invested a lot of money being held hostage for some specific amount of money? They had to pay or lose the account.
Rodriguez: Yeah, but the way it was happening is folks were trying to gain advantage. They gave over access to their accounts. It was classic ransomware. GamesBeat: I remember there was one ransomware outbreak when bitcoin was starting to happen. Hospitals were getting attacked because they couldn’t back up their data anywhere else, and bitcoin payments were untraceable, especially in eastern Europe. I guess they’re just building on this style of attack that’s worked elsewhere?
Rodriguez: For sure. There are a couple of ways to think of it. You can think of it as a classic con, a classic scam. First, is there some kind of weakness? Is there something somebody wants that they can’t get legitimately? If so, the scammer has the opportunity to offer that. That’s one facet of it. The next facet, is there an untraceable method or an ambiguity that allows the scammer to gain value without having to reveal who they are? That’s the blockchain component here. Being able to do it because you have an untraceable currency is part of what powers that kind of scam.
GamesBeat: What are you telling people they should do? Just don’t click on it?
Rodriguez: [laughs] One thing is, make sure that you are in a secure network environment. If it’s from work, does your workplace have the right protections in place at the computer level, at the login level, at the network level? That’s one thing to always have in mind. The other is very old-school, but if it seems too good to be true and it’s not being offered by the game publisher, then it’s not something that’s going to work out for you.
I know there are secondary markets for all sorts of goods and services in gaming, but the fact is, if it’s not coming from the publisher, you’re opening yourself up to risk. I remember working at Xbox 13 years ago. We had to tell people, “Don’t share your Xbox Live account with anyone.” You can’t share it with your friends. If somebody sends you a message saying they can help you level up in a game, that never ends well.
That’s the other thing you have to constantly remind people around. There’s no reason to do it, because in fact a lot of games now are designed well enough so that you can get a lot of value out of it within the game itself. There are all sorts of mechanics beyond just paying that allow you to unlock things. There’s no way to get that done illegitimately in a safe way.
GamesBeat: As far as Akamai itself, where are you contributing most here?:
Rodriguez: We’re now one of the world’s largest cloud security companies, which is funny if you think about us historically as a CDN. A lot of people think of us as a CDN, and yet we’re one of the largest security providers now. It’s one of our fastest-growing business segments. That means we’ve strongly adopted a zero trust stance, a zero trust philosophy, to our security. We encourage every company to make sure that there are multiple layers of security. You don’t ever make any assumptions that an authenticated or logged-in user is necessarily a safe user who has full access and whose machine or account hasn’t been compromised.
We offer products in that category, but we also take a strong stance that there should be multiple layers of authentication, and even once someone is authenticated, that doesn’t mean they should have free access to every aspect of the network or of a given account. There have to be many layers. That’s our position as a security company that serves a lot of big gaming companies. We see ourselves as a consultant in the space. We have a strong opinion around it. It’s part of what we do with the products that we build."

Casa announced in a post published on its official blog on Sept. 5 that the mobile wallet is now available for download. Furthermore, Casa notes that the latest version of the app can be used without the company’s hardware Bitcoin Lightning node, but users who do not connect the app to a node do not have access its Lightning Network capabilities.
The app supports a public address-naming system dubbed SatsTag. When Bitcoin is sent using a SatsTag, a new address is derived from the receiver’s public key and provided to the sender. Sending by scanning QR codes is still available.
The company also claims that the wallet is completely non-custodial and that the user keeps control of their private key — which is saved on the phone’s secure enclave — at all times.
The news follows another announcement by the company concerning the release of a node monitor and accompanying rewards program to promote Bitcoin network health.
Anemic demand for cryptocurrency apps:
As Cointelegraph reported at the end of June, the download count of cryptocurrency-related mobile applications is not increasing despite Bitcoin’s recent price surge. Data from mobile app analytics firm App Annie showed there were 65.8 million cryptocurrency-related app downloads in the first half of 2018, while in the first six months of this year there were 67 million, an increase of only 1.82%."

"content": "Many armchair traders are so focused on the short-term price movement of bitcoin that they forget to look at the big picture. For instance, the widely-followed analyst cryptoamd is expecting the dominant cryptocurrency to dump below $10,000 and then be tapping resistance of $10,500. That’s the trader’s short-term view on the digital asset. It is easy to get lost in short-term price action. However, some traders are resisting the lure of quick money by looking at the longer time frame. One analyst carrying a pseudonymous name “Nunya Bizniz” shared an interesting bitcoin trend on Twitter. It appears that the dominant cryptocurrency has always put together a massive rally following a predictable pattern.
Major Pullbacks Tend to Be Healthy for the Uptrend:
Analyst Nunya Bizniz looked at the bitcoin weekly chart and pointed out instances where the cryptocurrency had three or more consecutive red weekly candles within an uptrend. In the chart attached to the tweet, you will see how bitcoin rallied higher after a significant correction in the form of three or more weekly candles. Take note, the trend is only applicable whenever the king of cryptocurrencies is uptrending.
In addition, Nunya Bizniz appears to have only covered the price action of 2017 to 2019. So we took the liberty to expand the horizon to see whether the pattern holds. We discovered that it does. The green boxes show the number of times bitcoin had three more consecutive weekly candles while in a bull market. All of them were followed by a massive uptrend. 
Analyst: Bitcoin to ‘Show Considerable Strength in 2019’:
Nunya Bizniz is not alone in the expectation that the No. 1 cryptocurrency will surpass expectations after this correction.
President of Maglan Capital David Tawil spoke to CCN and revealed his long-term view on bitcoin: “I expect that it will soon trade to $15,000 and above. There is a lot of volatility in domestic securities markets and many currencies abroad are very weak in the face of a strong dollar. Those fundamentals coupled with an increasing number of businesses and financial institutions adopting blockchain technology and creating tokens will give the sector the necessary bullishness to climb considerably higher.”"

Open standards are better:
According to Australian news outlet The Sydney Morning Herald’s article published on Sept. 5, Dorsey is confident that Bitcoin is still the most likely candidate to beсome the internet's native currency. Twitter CEO noted: “I think open internet standards serve every person better than ones controlled or started by companies.”
Nobody understands the global economy:
Dorsey visited Melbourne to take part in the launch of Square Terminal, a new point-of-sale hardware device meant to offer an alternative to the ones provided by banks. He also expressed his ideas about banks and the economy in general: “Banks' control, authority and practices are a global phenomenon, but I think it's really acute here in Australia. [...] We're always heading into a recession, and we're always heading out of one, and anyone who offers an opinion on this is fooling themselves. [...] There's no one person on this planet that understands the global economy.” Dorsey also noted that he does not consider the idea of following the example of Facebook’s Libra and releasing a crypto dedicated to Twitter, and that he prefers using existing open standards such as Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the best bet:
Square’s mobile payments application CashApp rolled out BTC deposits in June. According to the data released in August, the company has generated $125 million in Bitcoin revenue in Q2 2019. Dorsey praised the first cryptocurrency: “I think [Bitcoin's] the best bet because it's been the most resilient, it's around for 10 years, it has a great brand and it's been tested a bunch. [...] As I look at all cryptocurrencies that could fill that role of being the native currency for the internet, [Bitcoin is] a pretty high probability.” As Cointelegraph reported in August, Square’s cryptocurrency-focused branch Square Crypto hired Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin developer Matt Corallo."

RCMP said the scammers are using caller ID spoofing, which the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre describes as a way of disguising phone numbers which appear on caller ID display.
The tool allows the fraudsters to make it look like their calls are coming from a local or familiar number, tricking people into answering the phone and trusting the caller. Mounties said the phone number reported was a valid RCMP number — but the calls obviously weren't made by police.
We've been made aware of this incident occurring a number of times this past week in Manitoba. The scam is designed to create anxiety so that victims respond by sending money quickly in order to fix the problem, said Cpl. Julie Courchaine.
We want to remind the public that the RCMP would never contact individuals through email or telephone to request payment or monetary transfers.
RCMP are asking people who have received similar phone calls to contact local police, or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre at 1-888-495-8501 or through its online reporting tool."

As part of the deal with regulators, customers will have to pass stringent know-your-customer (KYC) checks to use the exchange. New accounts will require a valid government ID and a social security number. 
In a blog post August 9, Binance US said that it’s considering listing 30 tokens on its exchange, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance’s native token, BNB. 
Binance US is still finalizing the list of states it’ll be available in, but we know that it won’t be available in New York since it doesn’t have a BitLicense–the necessary, and expensive, license to operate there. As soon as Binance US finishes working out which states can access the exchange, it will open up KYC onboarding a few days before the launch so that customers can deposit cryptocurrencies and open accounts. 
The news follows the launch of US-dollar-pegged stablecoin BUSD Thursday. BUSD has been created in partnership with Paxos, and is backed by the New York Department of Financial Services. BUSD will start trading on both Paxos’ and Binance’s exchanges sometime this month."

"content": "Anew strain of ransomware named Lilocked or Lilu has affected thousands of Linux-based servers all over the world. The ransomware started infecting servers back in mid-July but in the last two weeks, the attacks have become more frequent.
The very first case of Lilocked ransomware came to light when a user uploaded a ransomware note on ID Ransomware, a website used for identifying the name of ransomware from the ransomware note or demand specified in the attack. It targets servers and gains its root access. The mechanism behind how it gets access in unknown yet.
According to a Russian forum, bad actors might be targeting Linux-based servers that are running defunct Exim software.
Demand – 0.03 Bitcoin:
After a server has been attacked, the files are locked with “.lilocked” file extension. The note accompanied with the encrypted files reads: “I’ve encrypted all your sensitive data!!! It’s a strong encryption, so don’t be naive to restore it;)” Upon clicking the link in the note, users are redirected to a website on the dark web, prompting them to enter the key in the note. When the affected user enters the key, they are asked to deposit 0.03 bitcoin or $325 in the Electrum wallet to get their files decrypted.
Linux Ransomware Does Not Affect System Files:
Lilock ransomware does not affect system files but files with extensions including HTML, SHTML, JS, CSS, PHP, INI, and other image formats. Since system files are not affected, Linux systems are running normally.
As per Benkow, a French security researcher, Lilock ransomware has affected 6,700 servers to date. Most of these servers are cached in Google search results. However, the number of infected servers could be much more as there are many infected Linux servers that are not indexed on Google.
Since the mechanism behind the ransomware is not known yet, there isn’t a security advisory. You might evade this attack by keeping strong passwords and updating the apps as and when security patches arrive."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T13:24:04Z",
"content": "Facebook has suffered another major data breach, exposing the personal information of 210 million Facebook users. It follows the 2018 data breach in which 50 million accounts were illegally harvested by Cambridge Analytica. In the latest breach, a security researcher told TechCrunch that he had found a publicly accessible database containing Facebook IDs, phone numbers and in some cases, each user’s full name.
There were 419 million records in total, but a Facebook spokesperson said that many were duplicates, and old—from the times when Facebook let you search accounts by phone numbers. The majority of the records were from US users—133 million—while 50 million records were on Vietnamese users and a further 18 million from the UK. Overall, it was one of the largest data breaches in history.
“The biggest companies need to do more to protect the personal data of their users,” Assistant Supervisor Wojciech Wiewiórowski of the European Data Protection Supervisor, told Decrypt, in response to questions over the data breach.
“It is a whole business model in use that needs to be scrutinized and streamlined with GDPR requirements and legal obligations,” he added.
This is the same regulatory body that signed a joint statement last month, which criticized Facebook for not providing enough data about its plans for Libra—Facebook’s upcoming cryptocurrency project set to launch in 2020. 
Additionally, the Irish Data Protection Commission—which ran an investigation into Cambridge Analytica last year—has contacted Facebook for further details of the data breach. 
Sentiment is against Facebook’s Libra, says survey of 140,000 analysts
Following the scandal, Silvia Chiofalo, a spokesperson at The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner—the regulatory body for personal data in Switzerland—told Decrypt that ultimately, it’s down to individual users to take responsibility for their own data, because “the more personal data a company processes, the greater the data protection risk.”
And this is certainly the case with Libra—a mingling of personal and financial data, held in the hands of Big Tech. While the Libra blockchain itself will only contain pseudonymous addresses—like Bitcoin does—the Facebook-owned Calibra wallet will maintain customers’ financial data.
“All this does is give regulators more ammo to shut down Facebook’s banking and financial-sector hopes, as well as more ammo in pushes to break up Facebook,” John Meyer, managing director at venture capital firm Starship Capital—which invests in the blockchain industry—told Decrypt.
Meyer said that Facebook’s leak will increase regulatory pressure on Libra as faith in the social network continues to erode as the number of leaks increases. Congress has drafted the “Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,” which aims to stop huge tech companies like Facebook from launching their own currencies and is seeking a moratorium on any further development of Libra.
The market is stacked against Libra, too. According to a survey of 140,000 crypto analysts released Tuesday by Cindicator, 49 percent said they wouldn’t touch it. Of the nay-sayers, 29 percent said it was due to a lack of trust in Facebook, and 11 percent put it down to privacy concerns.
Facebook’s new PR team will have its work cut out."

"content": "Like an ancient mystic searching for glimpses of the future among the tea leaves, the popular cryptocurrency trader “Satoshi Flipper” tried to guess how a popular crypto token’s price would pan out. 
“Very bullish daily close for $LINK today,” he tweeted on August 15, above an annotated chart of LINK’s most recent price movements. “Not only because of the candle, but we closed above an important 23k sat level and now there is nothing between here and the next big resistance [at] 29k sats.”
Candle? Resistance? What?
Flipper was talking in the other-worldly tongue of “technical analysis,” an arcane discipline whose adherents are convinced they can predict the future prices of their investments by looking at past trends. You’ve seen them online: they talk about things like “moving wedge formations” and “fibonacci curves,” and they’re able to draw out trivial blips on graphs into 900-word articles on venerable sites with names like CryptoSponge. 
“Technical” analysis is starkly different from “fundamental” analysis. Fundamental analysts try to gauge assets’ “intrinsic value” by looking at “fundamentals”—revenue of the issuing company, news developments, technological prowess. Technical analysts, on the other hand, believe these fundamentals are already reflected by price, and that future prices can only be determined by looking at charts and analyzing “statistical trends gathered from trading activity.”
In other words, technical analysts are predominantly looking at data and doing a form of pattern recognition. To them, an asset can’t be over- or undervalued; the market just kind of shuffles along at its own natural pace, which can be analysed and understood using charts.
In crypto markets, technical analysis is wildly popular, because nobody has a clue about why things are valued (why is “JesusCoin” still worth a whopping $0.000016?), and the heuristic that the markets are always right is comforting and clarifying. But in the hands of an amateur, technical analysis becomes a dubious pseudoscience—the astrology of price prediction. 
Nevertheless, in the bizarre parallel universe of crypto markets, technical analysis can make a strange sort of sense. 
Crypto horoscopes 
Almost all big-time crypto fund managers—the people responsible for millions of dollars’ worth of clients’ funds—shun technical analysis. These people invest in the long term. Technical analysis, if it’s useful at all, favors split-second trades. Kyle Samani, of the large fund Multicoin Capital, says he eschews the practice entirely. As do Joey Krug, of Pantera Capital, and Nic Carter, of Castle Capital Ventures. 
Carter dismisses technical analysis because, in his view, cryptocurrency markets are mostly “efficient.” Things that are already broadly known, like news developments, technical specs and investor behavior, are already “priced in,” he says, meaning if there were any “alpha”—trading advantage—to be gained from understanding the human psychology behind trades, that would already be priced in too. Only uncovering wholly new information, which the market does not yet know, can affect an asset’s price."

"content": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told a group of business executives and free-trade economists that he believes the trade war with China could come to an end by the 2020 presidential election, according to people who attended the gathering.
At a private lunch in New York on Tuesday, Pompeo spoke in front of a crowd of about 40 people that included economics writer Stephen Moore, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Gristedes supermarket founder John Catsimatidis and former New York GOP chairman Ed Cox, according to people who attended the gathering.
Representatives from the State Department and Blackstone did not return a request for comment.
President Donald Trump has been levying tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods since the start of his administration, while China has been retaliating with trade barriers of its own.
Pompeo told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” earlier Tuesday that he wasn’t sure about where things will ultimately stand between the U.S. and China.
“I don’t know the answer to that. I have spoken to Secretary Mnuchin almost every day,” Pompeo told CNBC. “I haven’t been at the center of these actual negotiations. I’ve seen them make real progress.”
Moore said Pompeo, speaking at the lunch, sounded somewhat bullish on the prospects of an agreement.
“He still thinks that we can get a deal before the election. I think we would all agree that it would be better for the country,” Moore told CNBC in an interview.
Moore also noted that Pompeo still seemed hawkish on a China deal in the short term. Pompeo, according to Moore, pointed out that there continue to be hurdles to an immediate agreement.
“It’s been a tough slog to get China to agree to things. The hardliners are in command right now,” Moore said, reflecting on Pompeo’s remarks.
Catsmatidis also took away that Pompeo senses that China and the U.S. will come to an agreement over the next year.
“He talked about China. He thinks it will probably get done and they are not going to wait until 2020,” said the supermarket magnate.
The meeting was organized by the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity,” whose founders include Moore, former Reagan administration economist Art Laffer and former presidential candidate Steve Forbes. Catsimatidis is a member of the group."

"content": "Petroleum and natural gas production in the United States jumped by 16 percent and 12 percent, respectively, in 2018, setting new production records and placing the United States as the world’s single largest producer of oil and natural gas, 
the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday.
The U.S. had already surpassed Russia as the world’s biggest natural gas producer back in 2011.
Last year, the United States beat Saudi Arabia to become the single largest petroleum producer, the EIA said, noting that “Last year’s increase in the United States was one of the largest absolute petroleum and natural gas production increases from a single country in history.”
While Saudi Arabia is bound by the OPEC+ production cut pact and has been curbing its oil production, eager to prop up prices, U.S. shale production has surged over the past two years, also supported by the higher oil prices that the OPEC deal has brought.
Crude oil production in the U.S. jumped by 17 percent in 2018, setting a new production record of almost 11.0 million bpd, with the Permian contributing to most of the production growth, the EIA said.  
This year, however, the U.S. shale production has been growing at a slower pace amid lower oil prices as companies scale back drilling plans and budgets as investors clamor for more returns.
U.S. shale producers need to slow down this production growth and focus more on capital discipline in what is an oversupplied market, Continental Resources’ Harold Hamm said last week.
In its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) earlier this month, the EIA sees U.S. shale’s monthly production growth slowing at least until 2020, averaging 50,000 bpd a month from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the end of 2020, 
down from average growth of 110,000 bpd a month from August 2018 through July 2019. 
Despite the growth slowdown, the EIA still expects U.S. crude oil production to set record production levels in 2019 and 2020, at 12.3 million bpd and 13.3 million bpd, respectively."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-20T20:40:31Z",
"content": "Walmart is suing Elon Musk’s electric vehicle and clean energy company after Tesla solar panels atop seven of the retailer’s stores allegedly caught fire, according a court filing.
The Walmart suit alleges breach of contract, gross negligence and failure to live up to industry standards. Walmart is asking Tesla to remove solar panels from more than 240 Walmart locations 
where they have been installed, and to pay damages related to all the fires Walmart says that Tesla caused.
The Walmart suit, filed in the state of New York, alleges that: “As of November 2018, no fewer than seven Walmart stores had experienced fires due to Tesla’s solar systems - including the four 
fires described above and three others that had occurred earlier.” The filing details evacuations, damaged property and inventory.
Tesla’s stock dropped more than 1% after hours on the news.
Walmart claimed, among myriad complaints, that “Tesla routinely deployed individuals to inspect the solar systems who lacked basic solar training and knowledge.” In the suit, they also alleged that 
Tesla failed to ground its solar and electrical systems properly, 
and that Tesla-installed solar panels on-site at Walmart stores contained a high number of defects that were visible to the naked eye, and which Tesla should have found and repaired before they led to fires.
Tesla has been trying to revive its solar business of late.
On Sunday, CEO Elon Musk announced in a string of tweets that customers in some states can now rent Tesla’s residential, solar rooftop systems without a contract. The offer is available in six states, 
and will cost customers at least $50 a month (or $65 a month in California).
Although Musk touted the ease of cancelling a rented roof at anytime, the fine print on Tesla’s website mentions a $1,500 fee to take out the solar panels and restore the customer’s roof.
In the second quarter of 2019, Tesla installed a mere 29 megawatts of solar, a record low for the company in a single quarter. In its heyday, Tesla’s solar division (formerly SolarCity) installed over 200 megawatts in a single quarter. 
When Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 for around $2.6 billion the deal caused controversy that continues to this day.
SolarCity was founded and run by Musk’s first cousins, Peter and Lyndon Rive. Prior to Tesla’s acquisition, Musk owned about one-fifth of SolarCity stock, which was valued around $575 million at the end of 2015. 
While SolarCity had been a successful solar installer in the prior decade, its stock was plummeting, and debt had ballooned to $3.4 billion before the deal closed.
In an investor presentation meant to drum up support for the acquisition, Musk showed off what appeared to be sleek, glass solar roof tiles. Rather than bulky panels, they looked like premium shingles. 
The solar roof tiles are still not widely distributed or mass-manufactured.
Walmart and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment."

"content": "Home Depot (HD) reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday maintaining its beat streak of five years, missing narrowly on the bottom line but beating estimates on earnings.
Though Home Depot’s outlook looked good, its top line lagged a bit and has analysts concerned about the impact of the ongoing trade war with China and the possibility of a looming recession. 
CFRA analyst Ken Leon told Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade that the effects of the trade war are hard to measure for this particular retailer.
“This is a durable retailer, but it's based on home improvements. Again, July was very strong. Big ticket sales were up,” Leon said. “The question is, are you going to see that in the next six to nine months?”
The company slashed its sales and comparable sales view for the rest of 2019 due to rising concerns about tariffs and rising lumber costs. Leon also noted that slowed growth for Home Depot is likely anyway, 
due to the retailer having its strongest quarter of the year. But investors did not seem worried with the stock gaining 4.4% on the day.
“Today the stock is reacting well, and it's probably because their results are better than other weaker retailers,” Leon said. “The stock is acting really well, but last week, consumer confidence was down 6.4%.”
Falling interest rates has translated to falling mortgage rates, which has been bullish for the housing market. Credit Suisse analysts, however, recently warned of weakness when it comes to construction activity 
and home improvement spending which could hurt retailers like Home Depot and Lowe’s, which will report earnings on Wednesday."

"content": "President Trump’s strategy of defending the economy’s strength in the face of recession fears appears to have worked temporarily. The rebound in bond yields calmed markets on Monday, 
but the stock market dipped back into the red on Tuesday, with the Dow sinking after two sessions of gains.
Caught in this economic and political firestorm is Fed Chair Jerome Powell. He will be speaking about the challenges for monetary policy at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole Conference on Friday.
Powell has to walk a tightrope, as he faces relentless pressure from Trump to cut rates as quickly as possible, while maintaining the Fed’s independence. Markets have already priced in more rate cuts this year.
Indeed, that’s why the bar is quite high for Powell’s comments at Jackson Hole. “His last press conference after the July FOMC meeting left real doubt about the Federal Reserve’s future course of action. 
Markets think he will be clearer at the end of this week,” a recent Datatrek Research note said.
Datatrek Research co-founder Nick Colas says Powell may be able to avoid a sharp decline in stocks simply by signaling that the Fed will “embark on a steady diet of rate cuts through the rest of 2019,” he said. 
“Markets have become very specifically convinced of a certain pathway, which is one 25-basis-point cut at every meeting paradigm,” Colas said. “And Powell doesn’t have to say ‘yes, we will cut at every meeting by 25 basis points,’ 
do a mic drop and walk off. But he does have to indicate that he is amenable to a series of cuts.”
Powell cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point back in July – for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. That move didn’t satisfy markets or Trump. The president called Powell out on Twitter, saying, “As usual, Powell let us down.”     
Trump wanted a sign of more – and more aggressive – rate cuts to come.
On Friday, investors will be paying close attention to every word Powell says, looking for clues as to what his monetary policy strategy will be over the next couple of months amid a global economic slowdown, potential recession, 
and the looming threat of additional 10% tariffs on Chinese imports. Investor disappointment in Powell’s choice of words could “trigger carnage in the bond and equity markets,” Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, said in a note this week.
Fed Funds Futures prices indicate that most investors are expecting at least two rate cuts this fall: a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the FOMC’s September meeting, a 73% chance of another 25-basis-point cut at the October meeting, and 44% odds of one more rate cut or none at all in December."

"content": "Kristen Leigh Painter at the Star Tribune has a story on California-based Del Monte closing its 89-year-old Minnesota plant: “The closure, which is slated to take place on or around Oct. 21, will result in the loss of 69 full-time jobs and 294 seasonal positions. Layoffs will began as soon as Oct. 2 and will be staggered through next June as the plant finishes any remaining labeling, shipping and administrative work needed to close. Del Monte’s Sleepy Eye plant began operating in 1930 and produces more cases of peas and corn than any of the company’s other plants.“
FOX9 has the info, with visuals, on MnDOT’s attempts to avoid flooding on I-35W: “The first-of-its-kind project involves half-a-dozen large, underground tanks right along the 35W northbound lanes. The hope is that once completed, the tanks will store excess storm water the freeway drainage system can’t handle and thus keep the roadway clear.”
Ashley Lauren at the Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder talks to Twin Cities filmmaker Lee Jordan about his latest project, a documentary on Juneteenth: “His cinematic mission has been to bring forth insightful, thought-provoking and truthful information about Black history. Jordan wants to shine a light on the monumental African Americans who helped create the fabric of American history. ‘By finding your own thread in the American tapestry and following and seeing where it leads you … that helps you be able to tell your story,’ said Jordan.”
Renée Jean at the Williston Herald tracks the trade war in North Dakota, where farmers are feeling it the worst: “North Dakota already has the equivalent of an eight-lane super highway to China when it comes to soybeans. ‘We have all the terminals and railway capacity, and we have the export terminals in the Pacific Northwest that can handle soybeans quickly and efficiently,’ [executive director of the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association Nancy] Johnson said. ‘So we obviously are the most interested in looking that direction.'”
Brady Slater at the Duluth News Tribune outlines MnDOT’s plans to rebuild a cemetery disturbed by a bridge replacement project: “The hillside cemetery was disturbed by the start of the Highway 23 bridge replacement project over Mission Creek. That project has long since been discontinued and will start from scratch following the end of rehabilitation efforts at the cemetery, where all displaced dirt will be returned, the slope fortified and the cemetery boundaries defined by the state archaeologist.”"

"content": "It’s official. Uber is opening an office in Deep Ellum that will eventually employ 3,000 people. 
The company will have 400 people in place by year’s end. The mayor, the county judge, the governor, the Dallas Regional Chamber — everyone is super pumped about 
the decision to give Uber $36 million in incentives to set up shop. So good on us. I hope this works out. I’ll put aside for now my concerns about whether the company will ever turn a profit. 
Never mind the 400 employees who were laid off in July. Course correction. It’s all good.
Except wait a second here. One passage in the DMN story about the news caught my attention. It’s this:
Michael Morris, the director of transportation for the North Central Texas Council of Governments, proposed committing $10 million to $15 million to improve transportation in and around Uber’s office. 
Among the ideas, he suggested improving nearby sidewalks and bike connections, turning land under Interstate 345 into recreational or parking space …
Pardon? Improving sidewalks and bike connections sounds good. But more surface-level parking? These people work at Uber. Why would they get excited about parking lots? How does that make any sense?
And recreation space under the highway? You mean like the land grab that Royce West’s kid is attempting by building soccer fields? Despite what we are learning about pollution created by cars? 
A huge study was published just last week showing that exposure to ground-level ozone, fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, and black carbon — you know, car stuff — is basically like smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. 
Why take up smoking when you can move to Dallas and play under our highways? Great incentive.
I don’t know why Morris, the COG transportation director, said what he did. But what he should have said was: “Uber’s move to the edge of Deep Ellum makes it even more imperative that we tear down I-345, 
the elevated highway that practically abuts their new office. Developing that dead space, restitching the fabric of Deep Ellum and downtown — we can use Uber’s move as a fulcrum to lift this project to the top of our to-do list. 
I propose committing $10 million to $15 million to make it happen.”"

"content": "Our pal Francine McKenna at MarketWatch broke a pretty big news story today regarding an accountant who blew the whistle on Walt Disney Co.
Disney whistleblower told SEC the company inflated revenue for years [MarketWatch]
According to the whistleblower, Sandra Kuba, a former senior financial analyst in Disney’s revenue operations department who worked for the company for 18 years, 
employees working in the parks-and-resorts business segment systematically overstated revenue by as much as $6 billion in 2008-09 by exploiting weaknesses in the company’s accounting software.
Kuba’s whistleblower filings, which have been reviewed by MarketWatch, outline several ways employees allegedly boosted revenue, including recording fictitious revenue for complimentary 
golf rounds or for free guest promotions. Another alleged action Kuba described in her SEC filing involved recording revenue for $500 gift cards at their face value even when guests paid a discounted rate of $395.
Kuba has also alleged that employees sometimes recorded revenue twice for gift cards, both when guests bought the gift card and when it was used at a resort. Sometimes, revenue was recorded even though a gift 
card was given to a guest for free following a customer complaint, for instance, according to the whistleblower’s allegations.
Kuba told Francine that she has met with officials from the SEC on several occasions to discuss her claims. Disney calls her accusations “utterly without merit” and “unsubstantiated” and “definitely not supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” 
Ex-SEC chief: Markopolos targeting GE for a short-seller and not as a whistleblower ‘suspicious’ [CNBC]
Harvey Pitt, who was chairman of the SEC during the Enron scandal, had lots of things to say on CNBC yesterday about forensic accountant and Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos and his report on General Electric’s $38 billion accounting fraud.
On Markopolos’ motives:
“One of the ways you can test Markopolos’ bona fides, however, is the fact that the SEC has a whistleblower provision. And if he had brought all of his data to the SEC first, he would reap potentially up to 30% of the potential recovery that 
the SEC might obtain in connection with this case,” Pitt told CNBC.
“Instead what he did was go public, blast the company without giving the company a chance even to address his concerns,” Pitt said. “Those are factors that make this look suspicious.”
On Markopolos disclosing that he conducted the research into GE at the behest of a hedge fund, which he has refused to name:
“Until the SEC and the DOJ unravel the fundamental question of whether General Electric’s accounting was appropriate, I think Markopolos becomes, to some extent, a secondary issue,” said Pitt, acknowledging that GE is under investigation by 
the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices.
On GE audit committee chair Leslie Seidman’s comments that she stands behind the company’s financial reporting:
“Seidman used to work for FASB, which sets the accounting standards. These are not people who are ignorant of the critical facts,” Pitt said, adding that any suggestion that “they somehow either were not smart enough to figure out these problems” or 
“refused to see the issues they knew about” would take a lot to prove."

"title": "YouTube Plans to End Targeted Ads on Videos Aimed at Kids - Bloomberg",
"description": nil,
"url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-20/youtube-plans-to-end-targeted-ads-to-kids-to-comply-with-ftc",
"urlToImage": "https://static.videomaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/youtube-crowd-uproar-protest-ss-19201920-800x450.jpg",
"publishedAt": "2019-08-20T19:18:00Z",
"content": "To satisfy regulators, YouTube officials are finalizing plans to end “targeted” advertisements on videos kids are likely to watch, according to three people familiar with the discussion. The move could immediately 
dent ad sales for the video giant -- though not nearly as much as other proposals on the table.
The Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether YouTube breached the Children’s Online Privacy Act (COPPA). The agency reached a settlement with YouTube, but has not released the terms. It is not clear if YouTube’s changes 
to ad targeting are a result of the settlement. The plans could still change, said the people, 
who asked not to be identified citing an open investigation. A spokeswoman for YouTube declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FTC declined to comment. The agency is expected to levy a multimillion-dollar fine.
Since targeted, or “behavioral” ads, rely on collecting information about the viewer, COPPA effectively bars companies from serving them to children under 13 without parental permission. These commercial messages that rely on 
mountains of digital data, such as web-browsing cookies, are integral to the business of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, YouTube’s owner.
YouTube has long maintained that its primary site is not for children. (The company says kids should use YouTube Kids app, which does not use targeted ads.) But nursery rhymes and cartoon videos on the main site have billions of views. 
The platform’s many issues with children’s content-- horrific imagery, problems that led to disabling comments-- have troubled its video creators, worried parents and empowered rivals.
Getting rid of targeted ads on children’s content could hit Google’s bottom line -- but this solution would be far less expensive than other potential remedies that aim to placate regulators.
In April 2018, a slew of consumer groups complained to the FTC that YouTube regularly collected information about minors to use in targeted advertising. Once the FTC picked up the case, these groups suggested that the agency force YouTube 
to move all kids’ videos to its designated app for children, YouTube Kids. Joseph Simons, the FTC chairman, has floated another idea. He asked the complainants in a July 1 call whether they would be content with YouTube disabling ads on 
these videos, Bloomberg News reported earlier.
YouTube’s new proposal is even less drastic.
Right now, YouTube sells two different types of video ads, broadly speaking. One simply pairs the context of a video with a commercial message. So, a YouTube clip about basketball might have an ad from Adidas. The other type uses an array of digital signals. 
With these ads, marketers can reach viewers in a demographic group, such as homeowners or new parents, based on Google’s vast data troves -- websites people visit, searches they make and so on.
YouTube doesn’t disclose ad sales or prices, but most digital ads are more lucrative when paired with targeting data. Other tech giants, such as Apple Inc., have tried to cull back data-collecting tools in services that kids use. Loup Ventures, 
a research firm, estimates YouTube’s revenue from children’s media between $500 million and $750 million a year. Paring back targeted ads would dent that revenue, although Google has the ability to make its contextual ads more compelling to mitigate the damage, 
said Doug Clinton, a Loup Ventures analyst. He pegged the potential impact of YouTube curbing targeted ads at 10% of its overall intake from kids’ videos-- so about $50 million. “That would be the worse case, in my mind,” he said.
It’s not clear how YouTube would deliver this targeting ban with the thousands of video channels with whom it splits ad sales. It’s also unclear how YouTube would define which videos are “directed at children” and which aren’t.
One certainty: This proposal is unlikely to please complainants. In a July letter to the FTC, the groups argued that bans on YouTube ad targeting would be difficult to enforce. Removing the feature from select kids’ videos doesn’t guarantee that 
YouTube stops tracking web habits if children watch other clips, said Josh Golin from Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood, a complainant. “Is Google still going to be collecting all the data and creating marketing profiles?” he said. “That wouldn’t be satisfactory either.”
Jeff Chester, executive director of Center for Digital Democracy, another complainant, said that if the FTC settlement only forced YouTube to curb targeting, his group would likely challenge the decision."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-20T18:48:00Z",
"content": "When he was a younger man, Huawei’s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei joined China’s People’s Liberation Army as an engineer, at one point heading out with the army for 
China’s frigid north as part of a crew tasked with building a synthetic fiber factory.
That background no doubt inspired the overtly military-themed tone of a desperate memo Zhengfei distributed internally at the company on Monday as the US ban against it lingers, 
with the company founder warning that workers need to band together in “commando squads” to survive this “live or die moment.” The overarching message was that employees of the company, 
which is the subject of a now stepped-up ban as of Monday, need to redouble their efforts if Huawei is to survive. Workers need to “either form a ‘commando squad’ to explore new projects — in 
which case they could be promoted to company commander if they do well,” Zhengfei wrote in the memo. “Or they can find jobs in the internal market. If they fail to find a role, their salaries will be cut every three months.” 
Zhengfei sent out the memo on the same day US officials announced the addition of more than 40 more Huawei units to the existing blacklist, while also extending by three months a reprieve that allows Huawei to keep buying 
components from the US — essentially allowing the company time to wean itself away from the US. “If you cannot do the job, then make way for our tank to roll,” Zhengfei’s memo reads at one point, per Reuters. 
“And if you want to come on the battlefield, you can tie a rope around the ‘tank’ to pull it along. Everyone needs this sort of determination!”
Huawei employs almost 190,000 people globally and is the second-largest smartphone vendor in the world after Samsung, but unfortunately, the Chinese company finds itself caught in the larger 
crossfire of an ongoing trade dispute between the US and China. Huawei’s consumer division, the unit that sells products including smartphones, accounted for almost half of the company’s revenue in 2018, 
and while that division has historically been a reliable profit center for the company, it’s been hammered hard by the US sanctions.
The founder’s memo laid out the challenges in stark terms. The first half of this year “looked good,” but mostly because Chinese clients “were sympathetic,” 
a sentiment that Huawei can’t exactly count on to make up for lost international business. The founder’s plan includes putting more power in the hands of ground-level workers and trimming the company’s 
fat and any unnecessary workers and layers of management. “In 3-5 years time, Huawei will be flowing with new blood,” the memo declares. “After we survive the most critical moment in history, a new army would be born. To do what? Dominate the world.”"

"content": "GREENFIELD—In a deal valued at over $7 billion, Greenfield-based Elanco Animal Health has announced plans to acquire one of its chief rivals, Bayer AG's animal health business.
What this could mean to Hancock County and Greenfield was not immediately clear. Elanco's global headquarters has about 800 employees and is located off I 70 near the State Road 9 interchange, 
about 25-miles from Indianapolis. The company has two other Indiana facilities, in Clinton and Terre Haute, with total statewide employment of 1,265.
We don’t expect immediate impact from this transaction given closing isn’t anticipated until mid-2020, said Elanco spokesperson Colleen Parr Decker. Elanco has been growing in central Indiana over 
the past number of years. We anticipate this move will best position the company for long-term success.
In a press release Tuesday from Elanco, the company said the deal strengthens and accelerates Elanco's innovation, portfolio and productivity strategy, creating the second largest animal health leader by global revenue. 
The transaction will double Elanco's Companion Animal business, advancing the company's international portfolio mix transformation and creating a balance between its Food Animal and Companion Animal segments.
Joining Elanco and Bayer Animal Health strengthens and accelerates our IPP strategy, transforms our portfolio with the addition of well-known pet brands, brings an increased presence in key emerging markets, 
expands innovation, and accelerates our margin expansion journey, said Jeffrey Simmons, president and chief executive officer of Elanco. The move combines our long-standing focus on the veterinarian while meeting pet owners' 
changing expectation of pet care and access to products.
The deal is subject to government approval."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-20T18:20:00Z",
"content": "Welcome to 2019, when everything is made up and brands fight on Twitter about which has the best chicken sandwich.
If you didn't know, many fast food franchises offer chicken sandwiches. Some people prefer the pickle-crowned Chick-fil-A original. Others opt for Wendy's or Church's or whatever they need to buy at the next highway exit so they can use the restroom. It's not complicated. It's a sandwich, and people have their opinions.
However, we live in a time of endless, churning rancor, and at no point should we have expected that even our chicken would be spared. Over the past 36 hours, a feedback loop of sassy brand tweets from fast food chains has caused major upheaval among the chicken sandwich factions.
When recounting the Great Chicken Sandwich War to our grandchildren, our Boston Tea Party, our assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, will be Popeyes' announcement of a new chicken sandwich. The joyous occasion was sullied by a subsequent Chick-fil-A subtweet, which Popeyes was quick to respond to. Imagine future historians piecing together this complex political web.
But wait! Fast-food Twitter's resident rabble-rouser, Wendy's, had to have her say. Popeyes responded, but the chain's biscuits ended up falling to friendly fire.
Bojangles' and Shake Shack also engaged in some light saber-rattling, as did some lesser-known chicken forces. It was quite the battle royale. For some reason, Boston Market even entered the fray, trying to take a swipe at Chick-fil-A's new mac and cheese offering. You're fighting with the wrong weapons, Boston Market!
As cute as these exchanges are, they still have an uncanny Black Mirror quality to them, like when you get two Amazon Echoes to talk to each other. The more productive theater of the Chicken Sandwich War has played out among Twitter's paladins, with random users dragging Bojangles' and invoking the unassailable opinions of the ultimate chicken sandwich deciders: their grandmothers.
Like all serendipitous social media fascinations, there is a spark of academic possibility amid the chicken insults. After all, a chicken sandwich can represent so much: regional preferences, class divisions, cultural traditions.
Yes, one could pack plenty of socioeconomic insight into the Chicken Sandwich Discourse if it were given a chance to rise above the faux-squabbling throng of fast food social media directors. But one does not want to think about chicken sandwiches that much.  "

"content": "Morris Coffman has been a truck driver for 35 years. And he's been a conservative for even longer than that — his whole life.
That said, Coffman told Business Insider, [Trump] is absolutely a moron. His idiotic ideas will tank the economy even further.
Truckers, like Coffman, lean conservative. A Verdant Labs analysis of Federal Elections Commission data found that nearly three-quarters of truck drivers are Republican — 
one of the most conservative jobs in America, along with surgeons and farmers. And truck drivers supported Trump in droves, according to an Overdrive magazine survey from 2016. About 75% said they planned to vote for Trump, up from 66% who supported Sen. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. But a sharp downturn in the trucking industry and a slew of tax changes have hampered their ability to make a living. And many connect those two trends to Trump's economic policies.
He has not affected our business in a positive way, said one truck driver who asked to be quoted anonymously for fear their small business might suffer. He's killing our business. 
If consumers aren't buying, then there is no demand. This really isn't about my political leanings — it's pure business. Trump's tax reworking in 2017 led to many truck drivers having to pay hundreds in taxes this year, 
thanks to a change in per-diem laws. Dennis Bridges, an accountant who specializes in doing taxes for truckers, told Mother Jones in April that 75% of his clients saw an unusually large tax payment, and about 20% had to fork over more than $5,000.
That might've been bearable in 2018, when trucking capacity was tight, the industry was raking in cash, and truckers saw their pay jump. But now the trucking bloodbath, as Coffman and other truckers describe current transportation conditions, 
has meant low rates and low pay for truckers. Trucking has been in a recession since late 2018.  2,500 truck drivers have lost their jobs in 2019 as the transportation 'bloodbath' rolls on. Here's the full list of bankrupt trucking companies.
Transport research groups reported that the volume of trucks purchased in July fell to its lowest level in nearly 10 years. The number of loads needing to be moved in the spot market tumbled by 37% this July compared to one year ago, and rates 
have fallen by as much as 18%. I have witnessed many ups and downs in the industry but nothing like this, Coffman told Business Insider. Many, many owner-operators and drivers have either lost equipment or lost a job in the last year.
The Cass Freight Index says year-over-year trucking volumes have slipped for eight consecutive months. In June, factory-activity growth was its slowest since October 2016, according to the Institute for Supply Management. That means manufacturers 
didn't receive as many orders and there were fewer things to move. Truckers say the dip in manufacturing numbers — which they say are tied to Trump's trade war — is one reason there are so few jobs.
The truth about the rates being so low is Trump's trade policies, JL Sims, a truck driver, told Business Insider. Manufacturers are scared. Last month's manufacturing jobs numbers finally began to reflect the reduced production. 
Everyone looks at the unemployment rate and thinks, mistakenly, that the economy is in great shape. Manufacturing tells the real story. Analysts in trucking are hesitant to make the same sort of connections, however.
DAT Solutions senior analysts Mark Montague and Peggy Dorf previously told Business Insider that the downturn in global trade has affected only certain regions of the US trucking industry. Experts have said an exceptionally vibrant 2018 may be the bigger 
reasons for the downturn in trucking. Last year, trucking was incredibly profitable, with record-low bankruptcies, remarkably high rates, eight-month-long wait lists for new trucks, and huge bumps in trucker pay.
I view it as the market correcting itself, Cowen's Jason Seidl previously told Business Insider. We basically put too much capacity out there in the marketplace, and you saw that by the rates dropping very hard. The market can only take so much of that, so it corrects itself. 
And this is the market just correcting itself. Whatever the cause of the downturn, truckers are a key demographic for any politician to target. The segment of truckers called owner-operators, for instance — who are independent, rather than company drivers — 
are fiercely engaged with politics on the national level. Nearly 90% are registered voters, according to the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, compared to about 78% of the general population. More than half have contacted an elected official.
Trump has previously catered to truckers, pledging to slash taxes to help their businesses. America first means putting American truckers first, he said at a 2017 trucker event.
But truckers, including conservative ones, don't believe Trump has lived up to his promise.
You can not bully your way to a good economy, Coffman said."

"content": "Two federal bank regulators voted Tuesday to approve a significant rollback of a controversial ban on risky trades passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on Tuesday adopted a weakened version of the so-called “Volcker Rule,” which bans banks from making high-risk bets with their own assets. While the OCC and FDIC are but two of five agencies that must sign off on the new Volcker Rule, their approval of the proposal is the first step in a massive lobbying victory for some of the largest U.S. banks.
The Volcker Rule was one of several provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law designed to ban risky and overly complex investments that helped crash the global financial system in 2008. 
While advocates for banks have fought to loosen several aspects of Dodd-Frank in the nine years since its passage, firms with mammoth trading desks such as Goldman Sachs have paid particular attention to the Volcker Rule.
Named after its chief advocate, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the rule bans banks from certain “proprietary” trades, or investments using the bank’s own capital. Industry advocates insisted that while banks supported stricter limits on risk, the Volcker Rule was too complex and burdensome to be effective.
“The new Volcker Rule finalized today is recognition that the original rule was overly complex and unworkable,” said Greg Baer, president and CEO of the Bank Policy Institute, a research and advocacy group representing 17 of the largest banks and financial firms.
“The changes in the new rule will help reduce the incidental damage the original rule has done to responsible banking activity and legitimate market making activity, and the massive and needless compliance costs it imposed.”
But advocates for strict bank regulations said the Volcker rewrite effectively guts the rule and does nothing to prevent the build-up of risk that led to the 2008 financial crisis.
“As the threats from leveraged lending and global uncertainty increase, greedy Wall Street banks and Trump regulators are determined to put the financial system and working families in danger,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee.
“Trump regulators continue to open a Pandora’s box of risky trading and speculation at the expense of American taxpayers”
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the revisions “will not only put the U.S. economy at risk of another devastating financial crisis, but it could potentially leave taxpayers at risk of having to once again foot the bill for unnecessary and burdensome bank bailouts.” Financial regulators offered a variety of delays and exemptions from the Volcker Rule as banks pressed for broader changes, but the industry had all but given up on major fixes until Trump’s 2016 election.
Trump has since stocked bank regulators with predominantly Republican appointees, who have advanced several proposals to tailor financial rules defended by their Obama-era counterparts.
The new rule would scrap a requirement for banks to prove that trades enacted to make markets for clients’ speculative investments and efforts underwrite stock offerings comply with regulation as long as the firms follow certain risk mitigation requirements.
The revision would also exempt banks below certain asset thresholds from the rule, create three levels of increasing compliance requirements for banks based on size and complexity, and allows banks to use a looser standard to calculate risk for certain investments. 
Regulators and industry advocates supporting the Volcker rollback called the revision a moderate tailoring of the rule designed to provide clearer, more effective standards for banks.
FDIC Chairwoman Jelena McWilliams, who was appointed by Trump, said the new rule “will provide more clarity, certainty, and objectivity around the Volcker Rule, while tailoring the requirements to focus on those banks that conduct the overwhelming majority of trades.”"

"content": "Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, an Isreali drug maker, has announced that a generic version of EpiPen for kids is now available in pharmacies at $300 for a two-pack of the life-saving treatment.
The EpiPen is used to deliver a dose of epinephrine for people who are experiencing a life-threatening allergic reaction. According to the company, the generic version of Mylan’s EpiPen Jr comes in two doses: 0.15 mg for children who weigh between 33 and 66 pounds, and 0.3 mg for kids who weigh 66 pounds or more. The company last year launched the generic version of the higher-dose EpiPen, which was also priced at $300.
”We’re pleased to provide access to Epinephrine Injection (Auto-Injector) in two strengths for patients who may experience life-threatening allergic emergencies,” Teva’s Brendan O’Grady, EVP, and Head of North America Commercial said in a statement. “We will continue working to ensure availability of both strengths in the US and plan to accelerate production to meet the urgent need for this medicine.”
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year approved the generic versions of EpiPen and EpiPen Jr after years of price-gouging by Mylan, which in 2007 acquired the product—originally priced at $57—and was charging an eye-popping $600 for a two-pack of the epinephrine auto-injector devices by 2016.
Following the FDA’s approval of a generic version of the treatment, former Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement at the time that the decision meant “patients living with severe allergies who require constant access to life-saving epinephrine should have a lower-cost option.”
The approval also came amid an ongoing shortage of EpiPen treatments due to complications experienced by Mylan’s supplier Pfizer. Grappling with the issue at the start of the school year last year, Mylan convinced the FDA to extend the expiration dates on some of its EpiPen devices by four months after the company was able to show that the treatments would still be stable and effective.
In another bit of EpiPen news, Illinois last week passed legislation—which will go into effect on Jan. 1—requiring insurance companies cover the costs of epinephrine injectors for individuals 18 years old or younger.
“With steady increases in food allergies and other serious allergic conditions, families are relying on EpiPens more than ever before,” State Senator Julie Morrison said of the move. “We should be doing everything we can to expand access to affordable lifesaving drugs and medicines. No child with a serious allergy should be without an epinephrine injector because they cannot afford one.”"

"title": "181 Top CEOs Have Realized Companies Need a Purpose Beyond Profit - Harvard Business Review",
"description": "The Business Roundtable’s new letter could mark a turning point.",
"url": "https://hbr.org/2019/08/181-top-ceos-have-realized-companies-need-a-purpose-beyond-profit",
"urlToImage": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2019/08/Aug19_20_96572481.jpg",
"publishedAt": "2019-08-20T17:24:20Z",
"content": "On August 19 the Business Roundtable issued an open letter titled “Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.” One of the preeminent business lobbies in the United States, the Business Roundtable (BR) includes the CEOs of leading U.S. companies from Apple to Walmart. Sandwiched between the spare title and 181 signatures was a one-page declaration that ended as follows: “Each of our stakeholders is essential. We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.”
On its own, this sentence is indistinguishable from the anodyne commentary that fills the annual reports of many Business Roundtable members. For those actively following this topic, however, it represents a very public rebuke of the Milton Friedman worldview that guides business decisions behind closed doors. Friedman, the renowned University of Chicago economics professor, penned a famous 1970 New York Times essay, “The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits,” that helped launch a half century of “shareholder capitalism.” In this worldview, the business of business is business, and the sole focus of the CEO is to maximize the profits of that business.
The new statement by the Business Roundtable explicitly counters this view. Corporations are, according to the statement, accountable to five constituencies, of which shareholders are only one (customers, employees, suppliers, and communities are the others). In that sense it is a classic articulation of “stakeholder capitalism,” prevalent in Europe today and in the U.S. during the immediate postwar period. So while the statement itself is not notable, that it has the backing of CEOs representing nearly 30% of total U.S. market capitalization is.
The primary criticism of stakeholder capitalism is that any purpose other than shareholder profits results in a lack of focus and, ultimately, corruption. This critique logically follows from the view that CEOs can be self-serving arbiters of social value and would, if given the opportunity, divert resources to their own enrichment under the guise of “purpose.” In his 2019 letter to CEOs, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, disagreed with this assumption, stating in bold lettering: “Purpose is not the sole pursuit of profits but the animating force for achieving them. Profits are in no way inconsistent with purpose — in fact, profits and purpose are inextricably linked.”
This debate — whether purpose and profits work together or are fundamentally at odds with each other — can be informed by empirical research. And the findings of our ongoing research initiative on corporate purpose support the views of Larry Fink and now of the Business Roundtable: Purpose and profit tend to go together. Using more than 1.5 million employee-level observations across thousands of companies, we quantified purpose as the aggregate sense of meaning and impact felt by employees of a corporation. If the company has a strong corporate purpose, our research shows, its employees will feel greater meaning and impact in their jobs. This view reflects the opening sentence in the BR report: “Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity” (emphasis ours).
In our data we find that companies with high levels of purpose outperform the market by 5%–7% per year, on par with companies with best-in-class governance and innovative capabilities. They also grow faster and have higher profitability. However, the link between purpose and profitability is present only if senior management has been successful in diffusing that sense of purpose further down in the organization, especially in middle management, and in providing strategic clarity throughout the organization on how to achieve that purpose.
Our work also could help explain the obstacles companies face in moving away from such an exclusively shareholder-focused perspective. A company’s listing status and investor base is one such hurdle. We find lower levels of purpose in publicly listed companies, relative to private firms. Importantly, this pattern is driven by public companies with concentrated or activist shareholders. One may think we are picking up on a reverse effect, that activist shareholders choose underperforming companies that also have lower purpose, but this is not what is going on in our data. Instead, activist shareholders acquire large stakes of public companies, and then purpose subsequently declines among hourly and middle-ranked employees. To us this indicates the importance of firms’ strategically managing their shareholder bases and aligning their long-term strategies with the types of investors that would be supportive of it.
Incentives are another factor. We find that purpose declines when there is a larger gap between the pay of CEOs and median workers and between the performance-based pay of middle- and lower-level workers. Both can result from employees’ feeling that value creation is allocated unfairly within the firm.
Leadership is yet another one. We find that firms where the CEOs were promoted internally have a higher sense of purpose. Rising through the ranks seems to be an important variable when considering preserving the purpose of the organization. Finally, strategic choices, such as mergers and acquisitions, are also an important factor. We find that M&A tends to cause a decrease in sense of purpose, consistent with the idea that most M&A activity does not include enough due diligence on how it will affect employees and firm culture.
All these patterns are important to the discussion of the role of purpose in corporations and society. We live in an age where production is increasingly concentrated among large companies and large capital providers. With this greater market power comes expectations of a larger social role, whether that role is the choice of the CEOs or not.
What the impact of this one letter from the Business Roundtable will be is hard to know. On the one hand, it might be a cynical response to election-year rhetoric and policy proposals that worry the member companies of this powerful lobbying group. On the other hand, it may reflect a deeper response of national leaders to the falling social mobility, toxic polarization, and reduced trust in traditional institutions that we are grappling with today. Societal shifts seldom come suddenly. They often manifest as the gradual erosion of support for one worldview and the rise in support of another. And with this letter, we may be seeing incremental steps in that direction.
The authors would like to acknowledge their partnership with the Great Places to Work Institute on this research initiative, and specifically the support of Ed Frauenheim and Marcus Erb at the Institute."

"content": "The Justice Department is working alongside state attorneys general to investigate whether tech platforms like Facebook and Google are stifling competition in the industry, the department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, said.
The statement came only a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of states would be moving forward with an antitrust investigation into the tech sector that could be formally announced later this month. That new state-led probe would put more pressure on tech companies, some of which are already under investigation for potentially anti-competitive behavior by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission.
The FTC’s own antitrust investigation into Facebook could finish up as soon as next year, FTC chair Joe Simons said on Monday. “Any significant case that I’m trying to emphasize,” Simons said. “I would want to be out before the election.” Delrahim’s comments came during an interview at a Tech Policy Institute conference in Colorado on Tuesday. When asked if Congress should update its current antitrust law to more sufficiently govern the tech industry, Delrahim told reporters, “I don’t think so at this time. I think the laws we have are quite flexible. I think we just have to have proper, timely and aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws.”
His comments counter some of what Democrats in the House of Representatives have said in recent months. Earlier this year, the House Judiciary Committee’s panel on antitrust opened an investigation into major tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon in hopes of identifying how current law could be updated to better control the tech sector.
“After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases,” the House Judiciary antitrust chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) said in a statement at the time, “it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.”
The Justice Department opened up its “broad” review of the tech sector in July, but little has bubbled to the surface regarding what exactly the officials are investigating. Delrahim suggested that the department is still requesting and documents and that it “might be issuing compulsory process on some third parties who may or may not need it.”
Delrahim also touched on whether antitrust law could be used to address concerns Republicans have voiced over the past few months regarding alleged “conservative bias” on platforms. “It depends if it’s a competition question,” Delrahim told reporters. “If you have more competition, consumers may have different outlets to go to when a particular quality of a company may not be to their liking.”"

"content": "One Australian man visiting England said there’s a “massive hole” in his finances after he was wrongfully charged $68,478 for a single beer during a recent outing to a bar in Manchester.
On Sunday night, Peter Lalor ordered a Deuchars IPA from the bar at the Malmaison Hotel that should have cost him just $6.75, BBC reports, before things quickly took a turn for the worse.
Lalor, a cricket writer for The Australian in town to cover The Ashes competition, was speechless to receive the unbelievable bill for the brew. “See this beer? That is the most expensive beer in history,” he captioned an image of the seriously overpriced booze -- around $99,983 in Australian dollars – in a Sept. 5 Twitter post that has since gone viral with over 7,800 likes and 2,100 shares. The writer revealed that he “didn’t have his reading glasses” when the senior bartender presented him with the receipt for the IPA and didn’t think twice when the employee “had some problems” ringing up the transaction.
He was then overcome with a “sixth sense” that “something had gone wrong,” BBC reports. The man was dazed to learn he had been wrongfully charged the incredible sum for the drink in an apparent accident.

Australians find England pretty expensive usually, but this takes the cake, Lalor told the outlet. That's a lot of money. I'm just a cricket writer, I don't earn big bucks and it's costing me in interest.
Two days later, Lalor’s wife called to inform him that the whopping amount had indeed been taken out of their account – with a $1,711 transaction charge tacked on to boot. Lalor has since detailed on Twitter that he’s been in communication with the hotel and Visa to get the charge refunded – though the headache will likely take nine business days to process. “In the meantime there’s a massive hole in my finances,” he lamented. “Lesson to be learned: Always find your glasses when presented with a bill,” the bargoer concluded."

Mark Anthony Brands, which owns Mike’s Hard Lemonade, introduced White Claw in 2016 after consumers embraced sparkling water brands like La Croix. As the drinks surged in popularity, the brand has been experiencing a shortage this summer.
Beer and liquor drinkers — particularly of the vodka-soda variety — became White Claw converts for the brand’s 100-calorie combination of fruit flavors, seltzer and “gluten free alcohol base, which tops out at 2 grams of carbohydrates and 5% alcohol by volume. White Claw flavors are natural lime, raspberry, mango, ruby grapefruit, black cherry and pure, or plain (no, pumpkin spice White Claw is not real). As for the name, the brand says it “takes its inspiration from the legend of the White Claw wave - when three perfect crests come together to create a moment of pure refreshment.
In light of the shortage, the White Claw-faithful have been frantically tweeting at the brand and expressing their frustrations on social media, while the concept of a White Claw draught has inspired running commentary. Those who did locate the precious resource posted their findings.
“I’m gonna lose my god damn mind,” @CashMoneyDuffy tweeted White Claw on Friday, sharing a Complex article about the shortage. “Please tell me you have someone working on this?!?!”
“We have the best team in the business working on this,” the brand replied. We are working around the clock to increase supply given the rapid growth in consumer demand,” Sanjiv Gajiwala, White Claw senior vice president of marketing, told CNN. “White Claw has accelerated faster than anyone could have predicted."

"urlToImage": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/538885/broken-piggy-bank-white.jpg",
"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T18:30:00Z",
"content": "The retirement dream is moving out of reach for many Americans. A quarter of baby boomers expect to postpone retirement until age 70 or beyond, according to a report from the Insured Retirement Institute, and 8% don't think they'll ever retire.
Even if you're doing everything you can to scrape together some cash to put toward your retirement fund, saving for the future isn't easy. The average American thinks retirement will cost around $1.7 million, a survey from Charles Schwab found, and one in 10 thinks they'll need at least $3 million to retire comfortably.
Although it can be difficult to save for retirement, there are few things that may be making it harder than it should be. These mistakes may seem harmless at first glance, but they have the potential to derail your entire retirement plan.
1. Helping children with student loans rather than saving for retirement:
More than half (53%) of parents say that helping their children pay for college is a bigger priority than saving for retirement, according to a survey from T. Rowe Price, and 68% are willing to delay retirement to help pay for college tuition.
There's nothing wrong with financially helping your kids if you can afford it, but putting your own financial needs on the back burner can potentially lead to disaster down the road. Saving for retirement isn't something that can be done overnight, or even over a decade or two. Unless you have thousands of dollars to put toward your retirement fund each month, you'll likely need to start saving several decades before you plan to retire.
For example, say you want to retire at age 70 with $800,000 saved. You're currently helping your kids pay for college, so you hold off on saving for retirement until age 45. To reach your goal, you'd need to save approximately $1,100 per month, assuming you're earning a 7% annual return on your investments. But if you'd started saving at age 30, you'd only need to save around $350 per month.
It can be tough to strike a balance when you have multiple financial priorities pulling your wallet in different directions. But the longer you wait to start saving for retirement, the more difficult it will be to catch up. That's not to say you can't help your children with college, but if you ever want to retire, you can't forget about your goals, too.
2. Not paying off high-interest debt:
Debt in any form can be a strain on your budget, but high-interest debt in particular can wreak havoc on your financial health. Depending on how much debt you have, you could end up paying thousands of dollars in interest alone, and it could take years to pay off your debt completely.
In most cases, it's a good idea to start saving for retirement as early as you can. If you hold off on saving for years until your debt is completely paid off, you'll have to work significantly harder to save enough to retire. However, if you're saddled with loads of high-interest debt, you could be paying more in interest than you're earning on your investments. Especially if you have credit card debt (with some cards charging interest rates upwards of 20% per year), even a solid 7% to 8% rate of return on your investments may not outweigh what you're paying in interest.
In that scenario, it may be wise to pull as much cash together as possible and pay off your high-interest debt as quickly as you can. Begin with the debt with the highest interest rate (not necessarily the highest balance), and then work your way down. Once you're left with only lower-interest debt (like a mortgage or student loans), you'll likely be able to go back to saving for retirement.
You may still need to jump-start your retirement savings to catch up once you pay off your debt, but once you're no longer paying an exorbitant amount in interest, you'll have more to save each month.
3. Not having an emergency fund:
An emergency fund is a crucial yet often overlooked factor that can help you save more for retirement, yet only 61% of Americans have enough cash saved to cover an unexpected $400 expense, according to a report from the Federal Reserve Bank.
If an unexpected cost pops up and you can't afford to cover it, you'll either need to rack up credit card debt, take out a loan, or tap your retirement accounts for cash. Going into debt has its financial consequences, and borrowing or withdrawing cash from your retirement fund can potentially cost you thousands of dollars over time.
More than half of Americans have withdrawn money from their retirement accounts for reasons other than retiring, a survey from MagnifyMoney found. But withdraw from your 401(k) or traditional IRA before age 59-1/2, and you may be subject to a 10% penalty fee. You also could be missing out on thousands of dollars in potential future retirement savings, even if you only withdraw a small amount.
Compound interest -- which is essentially when you earn interest on your interest -- helps your savings grow exponentially. The key, though, is that your money has to sit untouched for decades to reach its full potential. When you withdraw or even borrow from your retirement fund, you're missing out on valuable time to let your money grow, as well as making it harder to reach your savings goals. But if you have an emergency fund to cover unexpected costs, you won't have to worry about dipping into your retirement fund to make ends meet.
Everyone makes mistakes, especially when it comes to retirement planning. However, some mistakes are worse than others, and the worst offenders can cost you thousands of dollars. But by avoiding these common mishaps, you can keep your retirement planning on track and make sure you're doing everything you can to set yourself up for success.
The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook
If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,728 more... each year!

"urlToImage": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/gunsopencarry_090619istock.jpg",
"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T16:21:32Z",
"content": "America’s largest retailers are rethinking their gun policies following a spate of mass shootings this summer in states including California, Texas and Ohio.
With uncertainty about whether Congress will do anything this fall in response to the massacres, the private sector has started taking action to address gun violence. Walmart, whose El Paso, Texas, location was the site of a mass shooting in August, said this week it was halting the sale of handguns and certain ammunition while urging its millions of customers not to openly carry firearms in its stores. Walgreens and CVS quickly followed suit, asking its customers to leave their guns at home. 
But not all major retailers have revamped their policies.
Below is a description of gun policies for the 30 largest U.S. retailers based on overall sales, as measured by the National Retail Federation.
Retailers that ban firearms: 

No. 4 Costco ($101.43 billion), 
Headquarters: Issaquah, Wash.
A statement on Costco’s website says the membership-based retailer prohibits guns in its stores and offers a refund to members who don’t agree with it. A Costco spokeswoman contacted by The Hill said she didn’t know when the ban took effect and that management had no further comment beyond the statement. At Costco, we don't believe it's necessary to bring firearms into its warehouses, except in the case of authorized law enforcement officers. For the protection of all our members and employees, we feel this is a reasonable and prudent precaution to ensure a pleasant shopping experience and safe workplace,” the statement reads.
“Our policy is meant to protect our members and employees in all warehouses around the world. This isn't a new policy, and we don't customize this policy for each city/county/state/country where we do business,” the company added. “If you believe that our policy restricting members from bringing firearms into our warehouses is unfair or excessively burdensome, or you cannot agree to abide by this policy, Costco will promptly refund your annual membership fee in full upon request. 
Retailers that request customers do not openly carry firearms: 

No. 1 Walmart ($387.66 billion),
Headquarters: Bentonville, Ark.
Walmart changed its gun policy on Tuesday, urging its customers not to openly carry guns in its stores. The world’s largest retailer also stopped selling handguns and ammunition for handguns and some short-barrel rifles.
“As it relates to safety in our stores, there have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers,” CEO Doug McMillon wrote in a memo.
The mass shooting in El Paso on Aug. 3 occurred at a Walmart store, leaving 22 dead and 24 injured.
“We have also had well-intentioned customers acting lawfully that have inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond,” McMillon added. “These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them, so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam’s Clubs in states where ‘open carry’ is permitted – unless they are authorized law enforcement officers.”

No. 3 Kroger ($119.70 billion), 
Headquarters: Cincinnati: 
Kroger changed its policy this week and requested customers not openly carry guns in its stores. A year ago, the company stopped selling firearms and ammunition in its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest.
“Kroger is respectfully asking that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores, other than authorized law enforcement officers,” Jessica Adelman, group vice president of corporate affairs, told The Hill in a statement.
“We are also joining those encouraging our elected leaders to pass laws that will strengthen background checks and remove weapons from those who have been found to pose a risk for violence,” she added.

No. 5 Walgreens ($98.39 billion),
Headquarters: Deerfield, Ill.: 
Walgreens announced on Thursday that it will ask customers to not openly carry guns in its stores.
We are joining other retailers in asking our customers to no longer openly carry firearms into our stores other than authorized law enforcement officials, the company said in a statement.

No. 7 CVS ($83.79 billion), 
Headquarters: Woonsocket, R.I.:
CVS said it is requesting that firearms not be brought into its stores, which number nearly 10,000 nationwide.
“We support the efforts of individuals and groups working to prevent gun violence, and continually review our policies and procedures to ensure our stores remain a safe environment,” the company said in a statement. “We join a growing chorus of businesses in requesting that our customers, other than authorized law enforcement personnel, do not bring firearms into our stores.”

No. 8 Target ($74.48 billion),
Headquarters: Minneapolis: 
Since July 2014, Target has requested that firearms not be brought into its stores.
We ... respectfully request that guests not bring firearms to Target – even in communities where it is permitted by law, the retailer said in a statement at the time.

No. 12 Royal Ahold Delhaize USA (Giant, Food Lion, Hannaford),
Headquarters: Carlisle, Pa.: 
Royal Ahold Delhaize is the parent company of numerous grocery brands, each with its own gun policy, a spokeswoman said.
At the 1,000 Food Lions on the East Coast, customers are asked to “voluntarily refrain” from bringing their guns with them.
“Food Lion complies with all federal, state and local laws regarding firearms in our stores. We always encourage our customers to be courteous and respectful to others when in our stores. We prefer for customers to voluntarily refrain from bringing firearms and other weapons into our stores,” Food Lion said. “However, we respect the rights of customers to carry firearms as allowed by law and we ask our customers to be respectful to others regardless of their views on this matter.” 
Christopher Brand, a spokesman for Giant Food Stores LLC, said, “We respectfully request that customers not bring firearms in our stores even if permitted by applicable state and local laws.”

No. 20 H-E-B Grocery ($24.02 billion), 
Headquarters: San Antonio: 
H-E-B, a supermarket chain in Texas, allows customers to carry concealed handguns, but it has a decades-long policy prohibiting open carry. In 2015, the company began posting signs about its gun policy at its stores to comply with a state law.
“H-E-B has always allowed licensed customers to conceal carry handguns inside our stores. H-E-B does not allow the open carry of handguns or long guns on our property or in our stores due to our TABC alcohol permit,” spokeswoman Dya Campos said in an email. “This is a long standing policy for decades, nothing has changed.”

No. 26 Starbucks ($17.41 billion),
Headquarters: Seattle: 
Starbucks requests customers not bring firearms into its stores. Former CEO Howard Schultz, who said Friday he is not running for president, made the announcement in 2013.
“Few topics in America generate a more polarized and emotional debate than guns. In recent months, Starbucks stores and our partners (employees) who work in our stores have been thrust unwillingly into the middle of this debate. That's why I am writing today with a respectful request that customers no longer bring firearms into our stores or outdoor seating areas,” Schultz wrote in a letter at the time.

Retailers with no gun restrictions

No. 16 TJX Companies ($29.59 billion),
Headquarters: Framingham, Mass.:
TJX Companies, the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, does not have a ban on carrying guns in its stores.
“We appreciate the seriousness of this issue and care deeply about the safety of our Associates and customers,” TJX told The Hill in a statement. “Associate and customer safety is, and always will be, a top priority. We do not sell firearms or ammunition in any of our stores and follow federal, state, and local laws regarding the carrying of firearms which we have done for many years.”

No. 19 Macy’s ($24.9 billion),
Headquarters: Cincinnati: 
Macy’s does not ban customers from bringing guns into its stores; instead, it leaves that decision to state and local jurisdictions or the shopping mall where the store is located.
“The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is Macy’s highest priority. We comply with all applicable state and local firearms laws and regulations, in addition to mall regulations,” a Macy’s spokesperson told The Hill.

No. 17 Aldi ($28.78 billion),
Headquarters: Batavia, Ill.:
Aldi’s code of conduct addresses employees, not customers, and requests they keep firearms in their cars if state law allows. The grocery chain did not respond to questions about gun policies for customers.
“Except to the extent that state law expressly permits employees to keep a firearm locked securely in their vehicle located in a Company parking lot, firearms, knives or other dangerous weapons should not be brought onto Company property for any reason,” the company says in its code of conduct.

Retailers that did not respond to questions about gun policies:
No. 2 Amazon (stores),
No. 9 Lowe's,
No. 10 Albertsons (Safeway),
No. 11 Apple stores,
No. 13 Best Buy,
No. 14 McDonald’s,

Optimum acknowledged the outage but didn't give any indication of the cause.
I discovered the outage after my low gas light came on, and I bounced around three gas stations trying to find one with a working credit card machine. Cashless and running on fumes is no way to go through life in a post-internet world, turns out. My solution was to scrounge through change draws and the bottom of purses until I came up with $8.65 to power my Subaru through the weekend.
Others took a different approach, tying up emergency lines and reaching out to police for assistance. Police in Fairfield, Conn. and Ossining urged citizens to not call them over their connectivity issues.
The outages appeared to subside around 9:30AM Saturday morning. How'd you handle your whole 14 hours without wifi? Let us know in the comments below.

"content": "Lyft is trialling a car-rental service in California, the company confirmed to Business Insider this week.
The service, which works much like a traditional car-rental, is available in San Francisco, Oakland, and Los Angeles. It also comes with a $40 credit to ride to and from the pickup location.
Rates are fairly similar to those of some legacy car-rental companies like Enterprise and Avis among others ($40 to $80 per day, depending on the type of vehicle). A Volkswagen Passat, for example, was offered at $75 per day when Business Insider reporters tried out the service on Friday. Other options are the Volkswagen Atlas, Mazda 3, and the Mazda CX-5.
The minimum age for Lyft's car-rental service is 22-years-old, the company says, and there doesn't appear to be an extra fee for drivers under 25, as with most car-rental companies.
The test is an extension of other transportation forms Lyft has recently expanded into, like bikes and scooters, a representative said. The company has long said it wants to see a world where no one owns personal vehicles and they are instead shared. This seems to be another move in that direction.
Lyft has long offered drivers on its platform the option to rent cars through a program called Express Drive. That's made possible through a partnership with Avis Budget Group, FlexDrive, and Hertz."

"title": "Dreaming of an Early Retirement? Consider Moving to One of These 3 Cities - The Motley Fool",
"description": "These cities boast lower costs of living, but they aren't short on fun retirement activities.",
"url": "https://www.fool.com/retirement/2019/09/07/dreaming-of-an-early-retirement-consider-moving-to.aspx",
"urlToImage": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/538634/hammock-on-beach-vacation-philippines.jpg",
"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T12:45:00Z",
"content": "Many workers spend years dreaming of the day they can finally retire, and for some, early retirement would be a dream come true.
Approximately 60% of soon-to-be retirees say retirement will be the most liberating phase in their entire life, according to a survey from TD Ameritrade, and 50% of survey respondents said they would like to retire by age 60. However, while many workers want to retire that early, only a third said they expect to be able to do so.
When you're saving for retirement, a lot of focus is put on saving enough to meet your financial needs. But another factor to consider is whether you can lower your costs in retirement. By living a less expensive lifestyle, you can retire earlier and live more comfortably without breaking the bank.
General living costs will likely be your most significant expense in retirement, and those costs are largely impacted by where you live. Move to one of these more wallet-friendly cities, and you may be able to save enough to retire early.
1. Sun City, Arizona: 
If you're looking to move to a community designed specifically for retirees, you can't beat Sun City. The median home value in the city is around $180,000, according to Zillow -- much less than the median U.S. home value of $229,000.
Once you start collecting Social Security benefits, you won't pay any state income taxes on them in Arizona. While you shouldn't rely too much on Social Security in retirement, the tax break can help save some money.
The general cost of living is slightly higher in Sun City than the national average, but the city has plenty of activities for retirees. With various clubs, events, and other recreational activities, it's easy to keep yourself busy during retirement while sticking to a budget. And because you'll be surrounded by other retirees your age, it will be easier to make friends and find ways to stay occupied without spending too much money.
This is key if you're planning to retire early because you'll likely have decades of free time. If you spend all your free time traveling or learning expensive new hobbies, there's a good chance you'll blow through your retirement savings too quickly.
2. Fort Meade, Florida: 
There's a reason why the Sunshine State is such a popular retirement destination. Not only does it have beautiful beaches and nearly year-round sunny weather, but Florida residents don't pay state income taxes on Social Security benefits -- making it one of the more tax-friendly retirement destinations.
There are several cities in Florida that make for ideal retirement destinations, but Fort Meade is one of the most affordable. The median household income is just under $60,000 per year -- nearly $20,000 more per year than the national average -- yet the city has a relatively low cost of living. The median home value in Fort Meade is just $108,000, and the overall cost of living is nearly 20% lower than the national average.
A small town with a population of less than 6,000 residents, Fort Meade is a good option for those looking for a quieter retirement. Yet the city is also only an hour's drive from Tampa, so there are still plenty of entertainment options when you're itching to get out of the house for a day trip.
3. Idaho Falls, Idaho: 
Idaho may seem like an odd retirement choice, but it has potential to be the perfect retirement destination for many people. Just over a third of people who have moved to Idaho in 2018 said their primary reason for moving was to retire, according to a survey from United Van Lines, and the state is one of the most popular destinations in the country for those looking to relocate.
Idaho Falls has the best of both worlds in that it's a relatively big city with plenty of amenities, yet the cost of living falls close to 10% below the national average. Idaho is also among the states that does not tax Social Security benefits, so the tax advantage can help your retirement income go further.
The city has plenty of museums, restaurants, and other social activities, so you'll have no shortage of ways to enjoy your retirement in Idaho Falls. The city is also a nature lover's dream, with miles of hiking trails along the Snake River and beautiful scenery, complete with the city's famous waterfalls. For those on the adventurous side, you can even visit Wilderness Ridge Trail Llamas to enjoy a hike through the mountains from the back of a llama.
Is moving during retirement the right option for you?:
Before retiring early to move across the country on a new adventure, be sure to do your due diligence and decide whether it's the best retirement option for you. If you're determined to retire early, take a close look at your savings to see just how early you're able to retire.
Don't forget about healthcare costs and Social Security benefits, too. You're not eligible to enroll in Medicare until age 65, and the earliest you can begin claiming Social Security is age 62. Also, there's a possibility that Social Security benefits could be cut in the next few decades. So as you're planning for retirement, make sure you're not going to be relying too heavily on your benefits to cover your expenses.
If you've decided that early retirement is right for you, make sure to do your research before moving to a new city. Take a couple of weeks to visit your prospective new town to find out whether you could see yourself living there. Try to live like a local and see whether it feels like home. Do you fit in with your prospective new community? Does the city have enough amenities to keep you busy in retirement? Will your friends and family be able to visit? Giving your new city a trial run can ensure you're happy there before you start packing your bags.
Not everyone can retire early, but it's not impossible. You'll likely need to supercharge your savings to make sure you have enough to last several decades, but lowering your costs by moving to a less expensive city can also help your money last longer -- and create a more enjoyable retirement for decades to come.
The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook
If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,728 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T12:30:42Z",
"content": "Hours after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he did not see the U.S. sliding into a recession despite uncertainty surrounding the U.S.-China trade war with China, President Trump had a few words for Twitter followers about China’s economic strategy.
In a late-night tweet, Trump claimed that Beijing needed to stimulate its economy because of the U.S. tariffs on more than $350 billion worth of Chinese goods, but once again slammed the U.S. central bank saying it “does NOTHING!”
“China just enacted a major stimulus plan. With all the Tariffs THEY are paying to the USA, Billions and Billions of Dollars, they need it! In the meantime, our Federal Reserve sits back and does NOTHING!” he wrote in the tweet.
The People’s Bank of China Friday, in a statement on its website, said it would cut the amount of cash that banks are required to hold in reserve. The shift pivots the country to the lowest level of capital reserves since 2007.
China’s stimulus package is estimated to bring an added $126 billion in available loans to kick-start growth.
Powell on Friday, while speaking in Zurich, Switzerland, said he “wouldn’t see the recession as the most likely outcome in the U.S.”
“The most likely outlook is still moderate growth, a strong labor market and inflation continuing to move back up, he said.
When asked if he felt whether politics influenced decisions by the U.S. central bank, he was emphatic.
Political factors play absolutely no role in our process, and my colleagues and I would not tolerate any attempt to include them in our decision-making or our discussions, he said.
Trump has often criticized Powell for stifling economic growth by raising interest rates in 2018.
In July, Fed policymakers cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis. They are expected to lower rates by another 25 basis points during their upcoming meeting on Sept. 18."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T10:01:00Z",
"content": "A sweet tasting bun that matched a meaty portion of chicken. Crunchy thick-sliced pickles. A good size fried chicken breast with crunchy pieces. 
Top it off with a slather of a well-balanced spicy mayo that doesn’t overpower and you’re tasting Popeyes' new chicken sandwich that has been the talk of the country.
But is it worth the hype? 
Call us curious. We had to take a bite into the sandwiches for ourselves.
We wanted to know how a fried chicken sandwich spurred a Twitter war, a lawsuit, made an angry customer draw a gun at a Houston Popeyes, according to CNN, when the customer couldn’t get the sandwich and created lines at Popeyes locations across the country. And at some locations, they limited the number of sandwiches you could buy with each order.
Popeyes' new sandwich debuted in mid-August and quickly fueled a social media storm.
Clearly, Popeyes' new chicken sandwich offering is meant to compete with Chick-fil-A's signature sandwich. Chick-fil-A responded with its own tweets touting its chicken sandwiches.
Once the storm brewed, Popeyes quickly ran out of sandwiches. Now, it appears, some locations are becoming stocked again. But as of last Wednesday, a sign was taped to the door of the Popeyes on Woodward in Highland Park saying it was out of chicken sandwiches.
We pitted both the classic and spicy Popeyes chicken sandwich against nearly the same versions from Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s. We included Wendy’s after several staffers mentioned being fans of its chicken sandwiches.
And now, drum roll, please. 
It was the sum of all those parts and pieces of Popeyes' new — and hard to come by — spicy chicken sandwich that Free Press taste testers declared as a winner.
But we must add: Popeyes' spicy chicken just barely eked out the win.
Chick-fil-A was very, very close. Out of the four taste testers, three deemed Popeyes spicy chicken the winner. The fourth chose Chick-fil-A because it came without mayonnaise. Wendy's wasn't even in the running. 
Nutrition-wise, nearly all the sandwiches' fat and sodium counts were high. But fat-wise, Popeyes has 42 grams — nearly twice the amount of all others — and the highest amount of saturated fat at 14 grams. But it is, after all, a fried chicken sandwich.
On the sodium counts, Wendy's spicy chicken is the lowest at 990 milligrams and Chick-fil-A spicy is the highest at 1,620 milligrams. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams a day. Ideally, the AHA would like to adults to limit to no more than 1,500 milligrams per day.

Overall winner: Popeyes Spicy Chicken Sandwich
Menu description from popeyes.com: A tender all-white meat chicken breast fillet, marinated in an authentic blend of Louisiana seasonings, then hand-battered and breaded in our all new buttermilk coating. Served with crisp barrel cured pickles and classic or spicy Mayonnaise, served on a warm and toasted buttery brioche bun.

Nutrition:

Price: $3.99
Judges comments: Attractive and inviting looking, well-made sandwich. Good size, thick chicken breast nestled in the brioche bun. The chicken was flavorful and juicy with the right kick. Everything was fresh looking and the way the sandwich was wrapped, made it look upscale.
Popeyes Classic Chicken Sandwich
Menu description from popeyes.com: A tender all-white meat chicken breast fillet, marinated in an authentic blend of Louisiana seasonings, then hand-battered and breaded in our all new buttermilk coating. Served with crisp barrel cured pickles and classic or spicy Mayonnaise, served on a warm and toasted buttery brioche bun.

Price: $3.99
Judges comments: Good size piece of chicken breast. Great flavor and a big yay to the crunchy pickles as well as the sandwich not being greasy.  It was as expected and the mayo was just enough.

Chick-Fil-A Classic Chicken Sandwich
Menu description at chick-fil-a.com: A boneless breast of chicken seasoned to perfection, hand-breaded, pressure-cooked in 100% refined peanut oil and served on a toasted, buttered bun with dill pickle chips. 
440                                  19 grams                  4 grams               1,350 milligrams
Price: $4.09
Judges comments: The chicken is really good and juicy. Though one judge deemed it nothing outstanding and another called it no frills and not particularly crispy. The chicken was bland and the sandwich was not well put together.  

Chick-Fil-A Spicy Chicken Sandwich
Menu description from chick-fil-a.com: A boneless breast of chicken seasoned with a spicy blend of peppers, hand-breaded, pressure cooked in 100% refined peanut oil and served on a toasted, buttered bun with dill pickle chips. Gluten-free bun or multigrain bun also available at an additional cost.
450                                  19 grams                   4 grams            1,620 milligrams
Price: $4.39
Judges comments: This fell flat a bit in looks, but judges said this isn't a beauty contest. Very juicy and the chicken is the star with this one, but on the salty side. It packed enough of a spicy punch that one judge said there was no need for mayo. The pickles were flimsy and no big deal.

Wendy’s Homestyle Chicken Sandwich
Menu description from wendys.com: A juicy, lightly-breaded chicken breast, crisp lettuce and tomato, and just enough mayo, all on a toasted bun. It’s extra comfy comfort food.
500                                  22 grams                   4 grams           1,020 milligrams
Price: $5.09
Judges' comments: This sandwich got very low marks. It was bland, messy and tasted institutional. Taste like any other fried chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich game has been raised and Wendy's needs to catch up.  

Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich
Menu description from wendys.com: A juicy chicken breast marinated and breaded in our unique, fiery blend of peppers and spices to deliver more flavor inside and out, cooled down with crisp lettuce, tomato, and mayo. 
500                                  19 grams                     3.5 grams                990 milligrams
Price: $5.09
Judges' comments: This was spicy enough and tasted better than Wendy's homestyle. But it still fell way short of the sandwiches from Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The flavor was OK for a fast-food chicken sandwich, but was nothing special."

"content": "TV today represents more than 1 in 3 smart TVs sold in the U.S. Now, the company is bringing its TV licensing program to European markets. At the consumer tech show IFA in Berlin, Roku announced it will now allow manufacturers to license its TV reference designs and use its Roku OS to build smart TVs for sale in Europe. It also said Hisense would be its first European Roku TV partner.
Today, the connected TV market is no longer limited to just the dongles, sticks, and streaming media players that plug into the HDMI ports of consumers’ TV sets.
Top companies like Roku, Google and Amazon are also making their operating systems and reference designs available to TV makers themselves, in a battle to gain consumer market share. Apple has been rumored to be working on its own television set powered by tvOS, as well.
Roku, to date, done well on this front in its home market, after first introducing the Roku TV platform at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2014. Hisense was then one of its first partners on the effort. Fast-forward to 2019, and there are now over 100 models available from over 10 brands in North America, and the company estimates that Roku TV is now the No. 1 selling smart TV OS in the U.S.
Roku isn’t alone in targeting Europe with its TV platform. Amazon this week announced more than 20 new Fire TV devices, 15 of which were TVs licensing its Fire OS. Many of these were also aimed at European consumers through partnerships with local brands and retailers.
The new Hisense Roku TV models will support 4K Ultra HD resolutions and HDR, and will come in sizes ranging up to 65 inches, Roku says. The models will launch in the U.K. in the fourth quarter.
“While consumers love Roku TV’s simplicity and advance features, TV manufacturers benefit from the low manufacturing cost, a variety of technology options, and support from Roku,” said Roku CEO and Founder Anthony Wood, in a statement. “The ability to quickly bring to market a leading smart TV experience that is regularly updated by Roku and is packed with entertainment gives TV manufacturers an edge in the competitive TV business. We are pleased to bring the Roku TV licensing program to Europe and look forward to the first Hisense Roku TVs in market this year,” he said."

Even as the UAW tells workers nothing about the supposed “negotiations,” it has issued a plea that they do not look to other sources of information, above all the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter. This is the essential content of a letter sent to Ford workers from UAW-Ford Vice President Rory Gamble on Thursday.
The letter begins by stating that its purpose is to “provide you—and especially our newer members for whom the bargaining process may be unfamiliar—an update on negotiations and where we are in that process.”
In fact, the letter contains no “update.” It states that “numerous subcommittees have been negotiating” and “most have reached tentative agreements,” but “larger economic issues remain.”
What these “numerous” subcommittees have agreed to, even what these “numerous” subcommittee men and women were talking about, is not explained. As for the “larger economic issues” that “remain,” workers are left guessing as to what they might be.
After submitting this “update” to the autoworkers, Gamble goes on to the main task at hand. “Many entities against us are attempting to skew perception,” he writes. “I ask that you be cautious of the sources from which you receive your information and the material you choose to share. It is imperative that we are not misguided about these negotiations by rumors, misinformation of outside influences.”
Gamble is too shy to name names, but he is clearly referring to the World Socialist Web Site Autoworker Newsletter. In 2015, when the WSWS was at the center of rank-and-file opposition among autoworkers, UAW President Dennis Williams—whose home was recently raided by the FBI—denounced “outside groups” who “like to stir people up,” while top AFL-CIO lawyer Bruce Miller attacked the WSWS as “vultures on the left dressed in red garb.”
Let us consider Gamble’s warning. Workers, he writes, should be wary of entities trying to “skew perception” and to “be cautious of the sources from which you receive your information.”
Solid advice, no doubt. It should be applied first and foremost to the UAW itself. After all, the organization has been exposed as a criminal syndicate that has stolen money from autoworkers and accepted bribes from the companies in exchange for pushing through pro-company contracts.
Gamble himself has not been named or implicated (yet) in the federal investigation. He only joined the top leadership of the UAW at the organization’s convention in June 2018, replacing the outgoing VP at Ford, Jimmy Settles.
Gamble, however, previously headed UAW Region 1, which includes the Detroit Area. In that position, he worked closely with Settles in the notorious 2015 vote at Ford, which led to widespread allegations of vote rigging and ballot stuffing. Settles orchestrated a last-minute postponement of the vote at Local 600 (which covers Ford operations in Dearborn) as the contract was headed for defeat. The final vote at Local 600 ended up being just enough for the UAW to claim a 51 percent ratification for the national contract.
In the above-mentioned statement in 2015, AFL-CIO lawyer Miller attacked the WSWS for “accusing the UAW of selling out its members with the contract settlement.” The fact that the UAW sold out its members—literally—has been amply proven. Everything the WSWS said about the contracts in 2015, and about the UAW, was correct.
Four years later, the UAW is entering these contract “negotiations” under truly extraordinary circumstances. Top executives and officials have been charged or implicated in an expanding corruption scandal, and the current head of the organization, Gary Jones, has had his house raided.
The most recent acknowledgement of guilt has come from Michael Grimes, a former top aide to Cindy Estrada, the current UAW Vice President at Fiat Chrysler. In 2015, Estrada was UAW VP for General Motors. Grimes pleaded guilty this past week to taking more than $1.5 million in bribes and kickbacks over 12 years, while he served on the board of the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources.
It is not only the UAW that is terrified of what will come out of this. The Detroit News' Daniel Howes, in a column published on Thursday, notes that “the legal quagmire ensnaring current and past leadership, and the political context enveloping a process turbocharged by social media, pose enormous challenges for the UAW and all three automakers trying to sell a prospective (and clean) deal to their hourly workforces.” (emphasis added)
The fear of “social media” is the fear that workers will be able to communicate and organize independently of the UAW. The unions and the corporate elite have the experience not only of the 2015 auto contracts, but also the teachers’ strikes last year, which developed largely outside of the control of the teachers’ unions.
The New York Times noted in an article at the time that West Virginia teachers “found ways to organize and act outside the usual parameters of traditional unionism,” including through “an enormous Facebook group.”
Whatever Gamble and the UAW may hope, autoworkers will not heed their advice. Workers are and will continue to share information online and organize opposition. The call of the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter for the formation of independent, rank-and-file committees is winning a powerful response.
A battle is looming, pitting autoworkers against the companies and their bought-and-paid for lackeys in the UAW. We urge all workers to sign up for the WSWS Autoworker Newsletter as the essential source of news and perspective for the coming struggle."

"content": "The Department of Justice is mandating that Google’s parent company, Alphabet, hand over any information regarding previous antitrust investigations into the tech giant, Google announced Friday.
This marks the company’s first public admission that it’s among the companies being reviewed as part of a wide-ranging, antitrust investigation the Justice Department launched in July. According to an SEC filing also made public Friday, the company has acknowledged an additional probe into its practices from “more than half” of the state attorneys general expected to be announced Monday, as the Washington Post reported earlier this week.
“The DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations, and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions,” Google’s senior vice president Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday. “We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.”
It’s unclear what that information entails, but it’ll likely include documents and findings from the Federal Trade Commission’s 2013 probe into Google’s business practices over concerns that it was throttling the smartphone and online search advertising markets.
Big tech companies have been facing increased scrutiny throughout this year as privacy scandals, in particular, continue to make headlines. Google’s disclosure comes on the heels of news from earlier today that New York’s attorney general plans to launch a multi-state antitrust probe into Facebook. The social media giant has also confirmed it’s being investigated by both the FTC and the DOJ for antitrust violations. The FTC recently fined Facebook a record $5 billion for privacy abuses linked to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a measure many Democrats denounced as a slap on the wrist.
In July, the Justice Department announced it was launching a probe into “market-leading online platforms” to review whether these companies “reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.” The move came after months of deliberation between the DOJ and FTC, both of which possess antitrust powers, as the two coordinated which companies to investigate among the big names in tech such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-07T03:16:00Z",
"content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange reserves rose unexpectedly in August, even as the yuan posted its biggest monthly drop in 25 years amid escalating trade tensions with the United States.
The country’s foreign exchange reserves - the world’s largest - rose by $3.5 billion in August to $3.1072 trillion, central bank data showed on Saturday.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected reserves would fall $4 billion from July to $3.100 trillion, likely due to fluctuations in global exchange rates and the prices of foreign bonds that China holds.
The increase in August was due to China maintaining a stable balance of international payments and generally stable economic growth, the foreign exchange regulator said in a statement after the data release.
Bond prices in major countries also rose, it added.
China has been able to keep capital outflows under control over the past year despite an escalating trade war with the United States and weakening economic growth at home.
Reserves have rebounded from an October 2018 low thanks to capital controls and rising foreign investments in Chinese stocks and bonds.
In August, the yuan CNY=CFXS tumbled about 3.8% against the dollar – its sharpest monthly drop since China unified official and market exchange rates in 1994. It is currently trading at 11-1/2 year lows.[CNY/]
China allowed the yuan to break through the closely watched 7-per-dollar level on Aug.5 for the first time since the global financial crisis, days after the United States said it would impose more tariffs on Chinese goods from Sept. 1.
Hours after the yuan slid, Washington labeled China a currency manipulator for the first time since 1994, but China’s foreign exchange regulator said such move had no grounds and did not accord with facts.
The yuan has now depreciated about 12% against the dollar since the two sides began exchanging tit-for-tat tariffs in April last year.
The regulator said in August it did not expect a disorderly depreciation of the yuan despite the impact from external factors such as trade frictions, and traders believe the central bank has been trying to slow the pace of decline.
The dollar rose 0.4% in August against a basket of other major currencies .DXY.

STIMULUS:
With downward pressure on the economy increasing, China on Friday announced further cuts in banks’ reserve requirements to free up more funds for lending. Analysts also widely expected modest interest rate cuts in mid-September.]
Growth is believed to be nearing the bottom end of the government’s 6-6.5% full-year target range, after slowing to 6.2% in the second quarter, its weakest pace in at least 27 years.
China burned through $1 trillion of reserves supporting the yuan in the last economic downturn in 2015, which also saw it devalue the currency in a surprise move.
China has been ramping up its gold reserves this year.
It held 62.45 million fine troy ounces of gold at end-August, up 4.85 percent from 59.560 million ounces at the end of 2018.
The value of its gold reserves rose to $95.45 billion at end-August from $87.876 billion at end-July."

"content": "Before Porsche had even shown the production Taycan to the public, it had a Nürburgring lap time. While we know well that the Taycan is not a direct competitor to Tesla’s Model S [or is it?] it seems that Elon Musk isn’t exactly pleased that people are talking about the Taycan instead of Tesla. As he is often wont to do, he sent a tweet yesterday ruling by edict from on high. Without anything to back it up.
‘Ring times don’t just happen. It takes months of planning. You can’t just rock up to the gate and say “I’m here to set a record.” You have to book manufacturer time, be on the schedule, pay the right people, and be in the right place.
According to the folks at the Nürburgring, Tesla has not done that. “Tesla did not send us a record request and did not rent an exclusive time slot,” a representative of the track confirmed to Road & Track by e-mail.
Another source familiar with the subject told R&T that Tesla is shipping a car over to Germany from California right now, but testing time has been booked for this week well before Musk’s Thursday afternoon tweet. It’s unlikely that the EV automaker will be able to jump into the lineup, and it is possible Tesla doesn’t even know that it needed to schedule time in advance.
Technically Musk just said a Model S would be on the Nürburgring next week, which still could be accomplished. It is an open-to-the-public toll road, after all. Tesla’s test driver could simply pay the 27 euros like everyone else and put the pedal to the metal.
If we do see a Tesla Nürburgring lap time next week, it will likely have been set during a Touristenfahrten open lapping session. It’s hard enough to set a new lap record when you have the track to yourself. Negotiating traffic will chunk several seconds onto your time.
I’d hate to be in the middle of a hot lap and have a Renault Laguna cut me off, nulling the whole damn thing. I only brought enough euros for two laps!
One other problem, the tourist days only run the track from Bridge to Gantry, cutting out a little section of the track. That means a “lap time” won’t be a full lap.
Best of luck, buds!"

"content": "Jailbreaking your iPhone—removing Apple’s restrictions that prevent you from installing any apps on your device that you want or messing with settings Apple otherwise locks down—isn’t for everyone. It can be a risky process to begin with, and doing it voids your warranty, but it’s a great way to extend the life of an older device or something you don’t carry around for everyday use.
Apple has made the process a lot more difficult over the years, which is why the recent revelations that there is a somewhat-easy jailbreak for iOS 12.4 (the latest version of Apple’s iOS) is pretty exciting. At least, you now have a small window to jailbreak your updated device before Apple releases iOS 12.4.1 to fix an iOS 12.2 vulnerability it accidentally unpatched—hence the resurrected jailbreak technique.
You’ll be using the popular unc0ver tool to jailbreak your device. And you’ll want to follow along to one of the many video tutorials that have popped up for iOS 12.4, as jailbreaking can be a little head-scratching if you’ve never done it before. Start by making sure you’re running iOS 12.4, which you can check via your device’s Settings > General > About screen. The jailbreak also only appears to work for devices using an A7–A11 chips, so, you won’t be able to perform the hack on your newer iPhone XS, XS Max, or XR, nor the 2019 iPad Mini or iPad Air, which all use A12 chips.
Assuming your device is eligible, you’ll want to download Cydia Impactor and the latest version of the Undecimus .IPA. Unzip and run Cydia Impactor, and then plug your iPhone or iPad into your Windows PC or Mac. Make sure your computer “trusts” your device, or vice versa, if you haven’t allowed that already.
Drag the .IPA you downloaded into the Undecimus app, and then enter your Apple ID and password. Once the jailbreak installs onto your device, pull up Settings on your device, tap on General, and tap on Device Management (which should be under Profile and VPN). Tap on your Apple ID and tap the option to “trust” that same email address.
From there, turn off Siri (via the top three options in your Settings app’s Siri & Search section), turn on Airplane Mode, and then use your device’s buttons to power it down. Power it back on. Once it loads, launch the unc0ver app. Tap the big blue “Jailbreak” button. Cross your fingers. When prompted to reboot your device, do that, and then launch the unc0ver app and hit the Jailbreak button (again). Repeat this process one more time when your device restarts, which should install the unofficial app store Cydia on your device.
I haven’t used this jailbreak myself, so I can’t confirm first-hand about anything else you’ll need to do to ensure it keeps working. As iClarified writes for earlier versions of iOS:
This is a semi-tethered jailbreak so you will need to launch unc0ver and tap Jailbreak each time you reboot.
If you don’t have a developer account you will need to re-sideload the unc0ver app every seven days.
We never said jailbreaking was easy. However, this is the price you pay for hacking your iPhone or iPad to run whatever you want. If you’re having trouble getting the jailbreak to work, I recommend checking out the incredibly healthy community over at /r/jailbreak, which might be able to answer any questions you have (assuming someone else hasn’t also encountered any bugs you’re seeing)."

"content": "On Amazon, a pair of headphones by a manufacturer called HiFiMan costs $2,250. According to reviews, of which there are 28 supposed buyers, one commenter said his pair broke and that he wouldn’t buy another pair again. (His review mentions that this was his second set from the company.)
Last week, we wrote about how to get rid of valuable electronic waste like your used Xbox and Playstation gaming consoles. If your headphones have stopped working, and even a repair shop can’t come to the rescue, it’s important to dispose of them the right way; headphones, like consoles, are complicated to recycle because they must be disassembled to be repurposed. Before you throw out your old pair of headphones, which may or may not cost a few thousand dollars, research your options so you can avoid adding to the problem of electronic waste. Send them to a facility that will recycle them
Typically, headphones are made of three components which include the speakers (that often contain magnets), a casing that covers those speakers, and a cord. Depending on the exact brand and model, there might be aluminum or copper wires, as well as foam or rubber around the pads around your ears, as Recycle Nation writes. Meanwhile, Airpods and its case are mostly made of various types of plastic and metal.
If you have non-working headphones, your first step before choosing to recycle them on your own is to check with the manufacturer. They may accept them and recycle the pair on your behalf. (Apple will recycle your broken Airpods and other Apple-branded products, for example.) Also, it’s good to check with the manufacturer to see if your headphones are still under warranty; it won’t solve your trash problem, but at least you’ll have the pair replaced for free.
If your manufacturer doesn’t offer a recycling program, do some research for nearby big-box retailers. Best Buy stores, for instance, will accept used headphones for recycling (or for trade-in, if they’re still working). Look for recycling kiosks just inside the store or just refer to the customer service if you’re unable to locate them.
Otherwise, use Earth 911's search locator to find nearby electronic waste drop-off locations. Search for “Audio Equipment,” your zip code, and results for nearby facilities will appear. Going through the effort of driving to a facility might not be worth it for a single pair of headphones, so it would be a good opportunity to assemble other electronics you want to dispose of, too. (Maybe you have a non-working gaming console or pair of speakers taking up too much space in your living room.
Otherwise, mail your headphones to recycling programs like those at JLab Audio; just enter your email, fill out a form, send in your headphones or earbuds, and they’ll recycle it on your behalf. They’ll also send you a code to receive 30% off any order of new headphones over on their website.
How to maintain the quality of your headphones
If your pair of earbuds are on their last leg and adhered together with only duct tape, there are a few things you can do to extend their lifespan (and to avoid purchasing a new pair time and time again).
As Gizmodo writes, you should take basic precautions, like avoiding too hot or cold temperatures or yanking out the cable to remove them—pull the end instead. Also, avoid submerging them in liquids and keep away from places with high humidity. And how you store them is important, too. “An easy way to make your earbuds last longer is by wrapping them up properly,” u/n00bcrusher wrote on a Reddit thread. “About 90% of the time earbuds stop working is because we don’t wrap them properly and the wire on the inside just splits in half.”
As this video from the Verge demonstrates, to avoid your headphones from becoming tangled and possibly stop working altogether, hold out three fingers and wrap the cord around them; toward the end of the wire, begin to wrap down the middle so it doesn’t come loose. (It should look like a bow by the time you’re done.)
And if you think your headphones might be worth salvaging, find an electronics store that might able to repair them, though it could cost more than to replace them depending on your pair.
Instead, if you’re able to, invest in a good pair of headphones like those from Sennheiser or Sony any other brand over the cheap ones you might find at a drug store; you might end up spending more to replace those cheap headphones. But don’t buy a pair that cost you $2,250. That’s just dumb."

And as you’ll see from the following list, there are some notable omissions. Here’s everything that will support Disney+ when the service launches on November 12:
Apple TV
Android devices, including Android TV
Chromecast
iOS and iPadOS
PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro
Roku devices, including smart TVs with the Roku TV OS
Web browsers via disneyplus.com
Xbox One consoles, including the Xbox One S and One X
Notice what’s missing? Amazon products. No Fire TV devices or Kindle Fire tablets will support the service, at least at launch. The Nintendo Switch is absent from the list as well, 
meaning that Hulu and YouTube are still the only streaming platforms available on Nintendo’s latest console.
It’s always possible that Disney+ could expand to Amazon and Nintendo’s products in the future, but for now, that doesn’t seem to be part of Disney’s plan for its new service.
That said, Ultra HD streaming does seem to be part of the plan—at least for select content that supports UHD 4K and HDR. You’ll need a strong enough internet connection and devices that can manage 
that resolution, of course, but Disney+ won’t charge you extra to access the best video quality you can get.
Disney+ will cost $6.99 monthly or $69.99 annually, or you can bundle Disney+ with ESPN Plus and the basic Hulu service for just $12.99 a month. If you’re curious about other features included in Disney+, 
or how the service stacks up to competitors like Hulu and Netflix, check out our comparison guide and our round-up of all the shows and movies that will be streamable when the platform launches later this year."

that includes Hulu (with ads) and ESPN+ -- a deal that's going to be hard for people to ignore, and that just so happens to be the exact same price as 
Netflix's standard plan. Speaking of, the US isn't the only country getting Disney+ on November 12th. Disney has announced that the service will be 
available on the same day in Canada and the Netherlands, for a monthly fee of $8.99CAD (or $89.99CAD per year) and €6.99 (or €69.99 per year), respectively. 
But that's not it: On November 19th, Disney+ is also set to launch in Australia ($8.99AUD per month, $89.99AUD per year) and New Zealand ($9.99NZD per month, $99.99NZD per year). 
The arrival of Disney+ to these countries marks the beginning of Disney's global rollout plans for its streaming service, with the company expecting to be live in most major global markets within the first two years.
We'll likely learn even more about Disney+ later this week, when the D23 Expo kicks off on August 23rd in Anaheim, California."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-19T19:53:49Z",
"content": "AT THIS POINT, Apple has locked iOS down enough that a full jailbreak—unlocking a device to install whatever you want on it—of current 
releases is extremely rare. When such a capability does exist, it's usually kept quiet and sold for millions of dollars by exploit brokers. But now, 
thanks to an apparent Apple gaffe, the latest version of iOS can be jailbroken at this very moment. There's even code to do it on Github.
As first reported by Motherboard, researchers discovered over the weekend that in its recent iOS 12.4 release, Apple had accidentally rolled back a 
patch that fixed a bug from iOS 12.3. As a result, it's possible to exploit the vulnerability to jailbreak iOS 12.4, making it the first current-version iOS 
jailbreak to be publicly disclosed in years.
It’s really a surprise to see, says Will Strafach, a longtime iOS jailbreaker and founder of Sudo Security Group. It's been so long since an up-to-date 
firmware could be jailbroken. But now that Apple knows, it won’t be for long. I expect an update within a few days. Apple did not return a request from 
WIRED for comment. Jailbreaking allows iOS users to add apps and other functions that Apple wouldn't normally permit to their iPhones. iOS has rigid limitations 
that are at least partly meant to protect users from malicious apps, but that also preserve Apple's control over the ecosystem. As a result, jailbreaking erodes 
some system protections, but it also allows users to break free from Apple's constraints.
Hacker Pwn20wnd posted a public version of the jailbreak on Monday that iOS users are already using to redesign the look of their iOS home screens and install unapproved apps. 
Researchers have warned, though, that jailbreaking potentially makes a device less secure, undermining protections that keep apps from reading each other's data, 
and opening the iPhone to potential attacks. An unscrupulous developer could even add functionality to an App Store-approved app that would trigger a jailbreak when a user installs it.
This is rather inexcusable, as it puts millions of iOS users at risk, says Patrick Wardle, principal security researcher at the Mac management firm Jamf. 
And the irony, as others have already noted, is that since Apple doesn't allow us to downgrade to old versions, we're really kind of sitting ducks.
Sudo Security's Strafach says that in detailed scans of the App Store he hasn't seen any such malicious behavior cropping up so far. But the threat remains, 
as does the risk that attackers might use other paths to compromise devices—tainted third-party apps, Apple's enterprise distribution certificates, or other remote exploits.
As a jailbreaking fan, though, Strafach also sees opportunities for exploration and insights that outweigh the risks. And he notes that as iOS has matured, 
jailbreaks have gotten harder to weaponize when they do crop up. But it's still not something to undertake lightly. The bigger significance of the incident relates to 
longstanding tensions between Apple and the security research community. The company announced earlier this month that it was finally launching a Mac bug bounty, after 
introducing an iOS program in 2016. And Apple even said this month that it will distribute special iPhones that are less restrictive than their consumer counterparts to security researchers. 
But the company is also in the process of suing the mobile security testing firm Corellium for copyright infringement, because Corellium offers a virtual iOS build that researchers 
can test on remotely. Both Wardle and Strafach point out that Corelliums tool could have been used to catch the mistakenly reintroduced vulnerability in iOS 12.4.
This shows that Apple continues to struggle with security—even on iOS which is clearly their priority, Wardle says. And this was uncovered by an independent security researcher, 
which illustrates the value such researchers add. Apple's more communicative approach with their new bug bounty program is good, but their attempts to shut down researcher tools like Corellium are bad.  
Whether you take the risk of jailbreaking your iPhone today or not, it seems like lately Apple is the one living on the edge."

"content": "Disney today confirmed its first global launches for the company’s upcoming Disney+ subscription service, and it outlined which devices and platforms will be able to access it on day one. The service is set to launch in the United States on November 12th for $6.99 per month (or $69.99 paid annually). Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand will be able to start streaming Disney+ in November. The company has said it aims to offer Disney+ in most major global markets within two years of its initial launch. It has also said a $12.99-per-month trio bundle of Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ is coming.
“Disney+ will launch in Canada and the Netherlands in tandem with the US on November 12th, priced at $8.99CAD per month (or $89.99 per year) and €6.99 per month (or €69.99 per year), respectively,” Disney announced in a press release. “The following week, Disney+ will launch in Australia and New Zealand on November 19th, priced at $8.99AUD per month (or $89.99 per year) and $9.99NZD per month (or $99.99 per year), respectively.”
More importantly, Disney also confirmed that it has reached global agreements with other companies that will let consumers access Disney+ on many of the devices they already use every day.
At launch, you’ll be able to stream Disney+ on these platforms and products:
Apple TV (tvOS), Android mobile devices, Android TV, Chromecast, Desktop web browsers, iPad (iPadOS), iPhone (iOS), PlayStation 4, Roku streaming players, Roku TV, Xbox One,
Amazon’s Fire TV lineup is the glaring omission from this list — at least for now. There’s always a chance it’ll be added by the time Disney+ goes live. Amazon Fire tablets will also seemingly be left without Disney+. It might be possible to sideload the app onto unsupported devices somehow, but that hasn’t been confirmed and there are no guarantees.
Disney says customers will be able to subscribe to the service directly on several platforms, including iOS. So yes, Apple will be getting a cut of those subscriptions. Disney also plans to integrate its content with the Apple TV app so that movies, originals, and shows will appear there among other suggested things to watch.
A Disney spokesperson told The Verge that Disney has nothing to announce regarding “channel” marketplaces like Apple TV Channels or Amazon Prime Channels. I wouldn’t bet on Disney giving Apple (or anyone) extra control over its hugely important service; allowing Disney+ to be streamed entirely within the Apple TV app would be a nice convenience for the customers who want it, but I don’t see it happening. At least you’ll be able to subscribe to the service quickly and easily without having to open a web browser to do so.
We’ll likely see and hear more about Disney+ this week at Disney’s D23 conference. The app will feature dedicated sections for each of Disney’s major brands, support offline downloads, and stream select content in 4K HDR."

"content": "On Friday night, the president once again tweeted about Apple . This time, however, things were a bit more positive. “Having dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple,” he wrote in advance of the meeting. “They will be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!”
The pair had dinner at Trump’s golf club in Bedminster, N.J. On Sunday, the president offered a debrief of the meeting after 10 days at the club, telling a small gathering of reporters, “I had a very good meeting with Tim Cook  […] Tim was talking to me about tariffs, 
and one of the things, he made a good case, is that Samsung is their number one competitor and Samsung is not paying tariffs because they’re based in South Korea. And it’s tough for Apple to compete with a very good company that’s not.”
It’s not the first time Cook has expressed concern of the penalties of tariffs in a meeting with Trump, though the mention of Samsung appears to have struck a chord with the president. The executive’s concerns have also been echoed by 
representatives from a number of different industries that have argued that Trump’s tariffs unfairly penalize goods produced by U.S. companies. A week ago, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) delayed tariffs for certain electronics, 
which Trump noted was done in order to keep prices down for the holidays.
In late July, Trump took to Twitter to hold the specter of tariffs over Apple, in response to reports that its Mac Pro desktop would no longer be produced in the U.S. “Apple will not be given Tariff wavers, or relief, for Mac Pro parts that are made in China,” he tweeted. “Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!”
Apple, meanwhile, recently touted investments involved in “creating and supporting 2.4 million US jobs across all 50 states.”"

Previously, all that we’d seen from the show were a few brief clips in a broader promo for Apple’s upcoming subscription service TV+, 
followed by an ominous teaser trailer that was literally just shots of a TV control room, accompanied by audio clips where people talked about how incredibly 
important the news business is.
This trailer dials down the Aaron Sorkin vibe and sets up a story where Aniston and Carell are longtime hosts of a morning TV show — but Carell gets fired, 
so a search for fresh talent leads the producers to a younger reporter played by Reese Witherspoon.
While the story and characters appear to be fictional, they draw on the real-world drama depicted in Brian Stelter’s book “Top of the Morning.”
“The Morning Show” is scheduled to debut sometime this fall on Apple TV+. This will likely be one of the first titles on the service (which still doesn’t 
have an announced price or launch date), but Apple has a lot more content in the works."

"content": "Depending on your connection and the size of your household, video streaming can get downright post-apocalyptic — bandwidth is the key 
resource, and everyone is fighting to get the most and avoid a nasty, pixelated picture. But a new way to control how bandwidth is distributed across 
multiple, simultaneous streams could mean peace across the land — even when a ton of devices are sharing the same connection and all are streaming 
video at the same time.
Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab created a system they call “Minerva” that minimizes stutters due to buffering, 
and pixelation due to downgraded stream, which it believes could have huge potential benefits for streaming services like Netflix and Hulu that 
increasingly serve multiple members of a household at once. The underlying technology could be applied to larger areas, too, extending beyond the house 
and into neighborhoods or even whole regions to mitigate the effects of less than ideal streaming conditions.
Minerva works by taking into account the varying needs of different delivery devices streaming on a network — so it doesn’t treat a 4K Apple TV the 
same as an older smartphone with a display that can’t even show full HD output, for instance. It also considers the nature of the content, which is 
important because live-action sports require a heck of a lot more bandwidth to display in high quality when compared to say a children’s animated TV show.
Video is then served to viewers based on its actual needs, instead of just being allocated more or less evenly across devices, and the Minerva system 
continually optimizes delivery speeds in accordance with their changing needs as the stream continues.
In real-world testing, Minerva was able to provide a quality jump equivalent to going from 720p to 1080p as much as a third of the time, and eliminated 
the need for rebuffing by almost 50%, which is a massive improvement when it comes to actually being able to seamlessly stream video content continuously. 
Plus, it can do all this without requiring any fundamental changes to network infrastructure, meaning a streaming provider could roll it out without 
having to require any changes on the part of users."

"publishedAt": "2019-08-19T08:00:46Z",
"content": "WeTransfer, the Amsterdam-headquartered company that is best known for its file-sharing service, is disclosing a €35 million secondary funding round.
The investment is led by European growth equity firm, HPE Growth, with “significant” participation from existing investor Highland Europe. Being secondary funding — meaning that a number of shareholders have sold all or a portion of their holding — no new money has entered WeTransfer’s  balance sheet.
We are also told that Jonne de Leeuw, of HPE, will replace WeTransfer co-founder Nalden on the company’s Supervisory Board. He joins Bas Beerens (founder of WeTransfer), Irena Goldenberg (Highland Europe) and Tony Zappalà (Highland Europe).
The exact financial terms of the secondary funding, including valuation, aren’t being disclosed. However, noteworthy is that WeTransfer says it has been profitable for six years.
“The valuation of the company is not public, but what I can tell you is that it’s definitely up significantly since the Series A in 2015,” WeTransfer CEO Gordon Willoughby tells me. “WeTransfer has become a trusted brand in its space with significant scale. Our transfer service has 50 million users a month across 195 countries, sharing over 1.5 billion files each month.”
In addition to the wildly popular WeTransfer file-sharing service, the company operates a number of other apps and services, some built in-house and others it has acquired. They include content-sharing app Collect (claiming 4 million monthly users), sketching tool Paper (which has had 25 million downloads) and collaborative presentation tool Paste (which claims 40,000 active teams).
“We want to help people work more effectively and deliver more impactful results, with tools that collectively remove friction from every stage of the creative process — from sparking ideas, capturing content, developing and aligning, to delivery,” says Willoughby.
“Over the past two years, we’ve been investing heavily in our product development and have grown tremendously following the acquisition of the apps Paper and Paste. This strengthened our product set. Our overarching mission is to become the go-to source for beautiful, intuitive tools that facilitate creativity, rather than distract from it. Of course, our transfer service is still a big piece of that — it’s a brilliantly simple tool that more than 50 million people a month love to use.”
Meanwhile, Willoughby describes WeTransfer’s dual revenue model as “pretty unique.” The company offers a premium subscription service called WeTransfer Plus, and sells advertising in the form of “beautiful” full-screen ads called wallpapers on Wetransfer.com.
“Each piece of creative is fully produced in-house by our creative studio with an uncompromising focus on design and user experience,” explains the WeTransfer CEO. “With full-screen advertising, we find that our users don’t feel they’re simply being sold to. This approach to advertising has been incredibly effective, and our ad performance has far outpaced IAB standards. Our advertising inventory is sought out by brands like Apple, Nike, Balenciaga, Adobe, Squarespace, and Saint Laurent.”
Alongside this, WeTransfer says it allocates up to 30% of its advertising inventory and “billions of impressions” to support and spotlight up-and-coming creatives, and causes, such as spearheading campaigns for social issues.
The company has 185 employees in total, with about 150 in Amsterdam and the rest across its U.S. offices in LA and New York."

latest update, and hackers have already used the opportunity to release the first jailbreak for up-to-date iPhones in years, according to a 
Motherboard report.
Apple, unfortunately, reintroduced a bug that was fixed in the iOS 12.3 update. As a result, all iPhones running iOS 12.4 can now be jailbroken. 
Pwn20wnd—the security researcher behind the unc0ver tool—released a public jailbreak for iOS 12.4 earlier today on Github. While jailbreaking was 
still doable beforehand, it’s been a while since you could do it on iPhones running the latest version of iOS. A Twitter search reveals that plenty 
of users have already confirmed they’re successfully running Pwn20wnd’s jailbreak. The flip side is the same bug enabling the jailbreak also means 
all updated iPhones are a bit more vulnerable to hacking. More specifically, security researchers told Motherboard that bad actors could take 
advantage of the unpatched bug to create spyware on Phones. It’s likely that Apple is already working on a fix that will be released with iOS 12.4.1—especially 
since it was a bug that had already been previously patched. Gizmodo reached out to Apple but did not immediately receive a response.
In the meantime, users running iOS 12.4 who have zero interest in jailbreaking their iPhones should take extra care downloading apps. Apple may have stricter 
guidelines regarding what apps are allowed in its App Store, but as security researcher Stefan Esser noted on Twitter, the public jailbreak means “any such 
app could have a copy of the jailbreak in it.”"

"content": "Disney just announced plans to roll out its new streaming service in November. Executives announced that Disney+ will be available 
on platforms and devices made by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Sony, and Roku. Missing from that list is Amazon, with whom Disney has had an on-again-off-again 
slap fight for the past few years. This ongoing feud means that if you love Mickey Mouse and own a Fire TV, you’re sort of screwed.
It’s unclear how or why negotiations between Amazon and Disney broke down, but the beef between the two companies is well documented. Amazon has historically 
been the instigator, too. As far back as 2014, the online retailer has repeatedly blocked Disney and Marvel titles from pre-orders, delayed shipping DVDs, or 
otherwise restricted sales. Around the same time, Amazon used similar tactics against Warner Brothers movies as well as titles from the Hachette Book Group. 
Experts suspected that Amazon was trying to put the squeeze on studios and publishers in an effort to negotiate better contract terms.
Amazon kept doing this to Disney, though. In 2018, reports emerged that Amazon was restricting sales of Star Wars: The Last Jedi Blu-ray discs to Prime 
members only. For a time, that product was listed as “out of stock,” although plenty were for sale at Target or Best Buy. The last time Amazon blocked its 
titles, Disney simply pointed people to these big-box retailers. Within a year, most of the recent releases in the Star Wars and Marvel universes were Prime 
member exclusives. It makes you wonder if Amazon was trying to bully Disney again or simply bully its own superhero-loving customers into paying for Prime 
memberships.
Who knows what to make of Disney boxing Amazon out of the Disney Plus launch. There’s a chance that it’s yet another contract dispute that’s left Fire TV 
customers without full access to Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic content. (Those are the big five Disney brands included in the service.) 
It’s also entirely possible that Disney and Amazon will sort all this out before November.
That said, if you’re not a Fire TV owner, and you love Disney content, you can look forward to paying for a new streaming service soon! Disney+ will be 
available on November 12 for $7 a month or $70 a year in the United States. The service will launch the same day in Canada and the Netherlands, and it will 
go live in Australia and New Zealand on November 19. Once again, Disney+ will be available on a ton of devices and platforms including Apple TV, iOS, Google 
Chromecast, Android, Android TV, Microsoft Xbox One, Sony PlayStation 4, Roku set-top boxes, and Roku TVs."

corporate blunders, littered with yesterday’s top 8 friends, scrubbed n00ds, trashed chiptune tracks, bomb threats, and downy unicorn costumes. 
Comedic treasures were born and abandoned by parent companies; screaming crowds running through billowing tear gas from police vanished behind 
defunct video players. Devs dreamed of love, artists of postmodern interfaces, and unknowns of entertainment careers. Netizens injured themselves 
for stunts, by accident, and on purpose. We submitted to our overlord Mark Zuckerberg and the army of influencers. And so many rubber ducks wailed. 
“Their obituaries tell us what we already know–that your feed could look a lot more interesting, more avant-garde, joyous, local, intimate, kinky, 
weird, and hilarious–and yes, scarier and even more hateful than it does now.” Lots of corporations (mostly Google) have competed with Facebook for 
the social media colonies, and their attempts aren’t missed; but Facebook’s monopoly also beat out the divey-er venues and communal spaces which 
elevated their members to five minutes of fame and triple platinum albums without sponcon. Their obituaries tell us what we already know–that your 
feed could look a lot more interesting, more avant-garde, joyous, local, intimate, kinky, weird, and hilarious–and yes, scarier and even more hateful 
than it does now–thanks to varying degrees of censorship, cross-platform embeds, aesthetic customization, technopanic, and algorithm-free zones. 
It’s not to say that without Facebook, the whole internet would be more like a local farmer’s market or a punk venue or an art gallery or comedy club or a 
Narnia fanfic club, just that those places are harder to find these days. It’s 2003, and the future is a white guy in a wide-collar button-down behind a 
Honda CR-V of laptops (a Dell, possibly?) in a 250 pixel-wide frame. That’s Friendster founder Jonathan Abrams, featured in an SF Weekly story by Lessley 
Anderson. In it, she describes the strange experience of opening your laptop onto the world of social media, and Friendster’s exciting premise that all 
people are connected by six degrees of separation:
“Your induction into Friendster starts out innocently enough: You receive an e-mail invitation from a friend. It doesn’t cost anything to join, so you give 
it a whirl. You answer questions about your profession, favorite books, movies, music, and other interests, then upload a digital photo of yourself.
Thumbnail versions of your friends’ photos appear on your profile page like a collection of trading cards. Clicking on their pictures takes you to their 
pages, where you can see all of their friends, and so on. Even with only a few friends, you find that — through friends of friends — you suddenly have access 
to a social network of thousands of people.” Friendster, which Abrams is believed to have conceived as a dating site, reportedly signed up three million 
users in its first three months; copycats Myspace, Ringo.com, and Orkut followed. “Thumbnail versions of your friends’ photos appear on your profile page 
like a collection of trading cards.” Friendster’s conceptual vastness, connecting all people on the internet, could have been its downfall; in attempts to 
reach even more people, Fakesters like “Homer Simpson” and “Jesus” popped up for the sole purpose of amassing friend collections, and friend groups became 
more and more diluted.
By the New York Times’s and Abrams’s own account, though, hubris killed Friendster. A group of venture capitalists persuaded Abrams to turn down a $30 
million offer from Google and then ran it into the ground with novel features rather than keeping the creaky site functioning smoothly. Pages just didn’t load.
Friendster was largely considered dead by 2006. In 2009, it was redesigned and acquired by a Malaysian payments company for a reported $40 million; in 2011, 
it deleted all of its user profiles and announced a do over as a social gaming platform; in 2015, Friendster announced that it was “taking a break.” It 
never returned, and many of its early users reportedly defected to Myspace. We outgrew our side-swipe bangs, burned our diaries, and moved into Facebook’s 
collegial suburbs. But why?
In 2008, two years after reportedly surpassing Google as the most-visited website in the United States, Facebook eclipsed Myspace’s monthly user count. 
In 2011, when Myspace announced it was laying off half its staff, the New York Times attributed its decline to “fickle consumers and changing tastes”; 
a corporate “culture clash”; litter of celebrity promotion and pop-up ads; and Facebook’s standardized utilitarian interface–meaning that prefab profiles 
with names stylings like John Doe versus jdoe1234 were appealing to people. Forbes attributes Facebook’s generic design and its slow expansion through 
universities (with school email address verifications) and 13+ age policy to a perception that Facebook was a “safe space,” which would have incidentally 
coincided with a technopanic created by news reports of pedophilia. Social media scholar danah boyd performed an extensive study finding that racism also 
played a part, with upper-middle class white users deciding to wall off into exclusive groups.
It is true that Myspace withered after News Corporation bought it for $580 million in 2005. Hefty layoffs followed in 2009 and 2011; it was sold and 
bought and sold and bought again for a fraction of the price. In 2011, just like Friendster, CEO Mike Jones announced that they would no longer try to 
rival Facebook in social networking and described their new strategy as a “social entertainment” site like Huffington Post, whatever that means. In March, 
the company admitted that they’d lost practically all of their user data pre-2016. LinkedIn lists 393 current employees at the company, down from 1,300 in 2009.
That is too bad because today there’s no parallel. Myspace was originally designed so that you could go down a rabbit hole of bands’ pages, finding who 
influenced each other from their friends and posts, making it easy for non-coastal local bands to get followings and book shows. Those unknowns certainly 
aren’t coming up on your algorithmically-sorted feed. Bebo wouldn’t be on the list, if not for a stunning bit of maneuvering at the outset of the corporate 
crusade to blindly colonize social media at any expense. Which made spouses Xochi and Michael Birch wealthy beyond a start-up’s wildest dreams. In 2008, AOL 
bought Bebo for $850 million in what Gawker called “the best social-network cashout to date.” Wired wrote in 2013 that Bebo “was never, not for one bright 
shining moment, ever regarded as a leading network,” more a “tool to exploit big clueless corporate suitors.”
Despite its impressive 2005 debut, hitting one million users nine days after its launch, Bebo did indeed fail to distinguish itself; in 2010, AOL sold it 
to a private equity fund for $10 million; in 2013, Birch bought it back for $1 million and announced a planned relaunch which didn’t take off.
Then they donated the leftovers to Myspace Tom in solidarity.
Not really, but they have reportedly given millions to charity:water and shepherded it to philanthropists of Silicon Valley. They made a fancy members-only 
post-gentrification-New York club in San Francisco which was considered lame. And then the Queen awarded them both OBEs. One of many failed attempts to 
thwart Facebook, OpenSocial was conceived by an “alliance” between Google, Myspace, and struggling social networks to combat Facebook’s amassment of games 
and apps by independent developers. The OpenSocial software presumably would attract more developers with standardized API to distribute apps across all sites. 
It’s still around, but it’s mostly described now in the past tense. Reddit product strategist Jason Costa wrote in 2017 that the various languages across sites’ 
containers would have been a headache for developers who had to rewrite their programs for each network; in 2010, Brian Balfour, co-founder of the gaming platform 
Viximio, wrote for Adweek that the project had fizzled out mainly due to lack of follow-through. Nobody knows of ConnectU because it’s the Facebook that never 
was; nobody references it as the misfortunate underdog because it’s not the Facebook we need.
Mark Zuckerberg’s classmates Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused him of stealing their idea for an exclusive Harvard 
student/alumni dating network “ConnectU,” which they’d thought up in 2002. They alleged that they’d asked him to finish programming ConnectU, and that 
instead of delivering as promised, Zuckerberg delayed ConnectU and launched Facebook.
The ConnectU guys went on to try a few more ideas, like ConnectHi for high schoolers and Social Butterfly, a ConnectU feature which would allow you to 
integrate your connections from outside networks like Facebook. In 2007, at which point Facebook had 31 million users, they sued Facebook for a laundry 
list of allegations including misappropriation of trade secrets, copyright infringement, and fraud. The complaint argues that ConnectU’s original Harvard-only 
base of “well-educated students and alumni” would have been an “attractive demographic for many advertisers,” which is true, but not exactly heartbreaking.
The Guardian reported in 2009 that Facebook paid up to $65 million in cash and shares. Divya Narendra defends Facebook on TV now, and the Winklevoss brothers
are Bitcoin billionaires. They’re all on Facebook. Imagine a craigslist for burners, and you had tribe.net, a site for both unloading queen-size bed frames 
and fostering community groups for (mainly) the Bay Area Burning Man crowd and “proud freaks” called “tribes.” The site, founded by Zynga founder Mark Pincus, 
doesn’t seem to have cracked a million users, but it was a sanctum for worshippers of sailor flesh, wheat-free enthusiasts, and wolven clans for elves who are also wolves.
In 2005, tribe announced that it was barring sexually explicit and offensive content, amidst the Justice Department’s crackdown on internet porn, and a reported 
advertiser scare. A “Terms of Use Guy” appeared to surveil and report “offensive content.” With him went the smart girls’ porn club, and eventually, the users.
In 2006, Pincus blogged that new management, or “a big stupid masthead” had commandeered control of the site, that he was reclaiming control and 
“returning the tribe to users.” In 2008, while Pincus’s other company Zynga was building an empire of games on Facebook (like FarmVille), he told SF 
Weekly that he was keeping tribe up because it “serves a really valuable role in the community”–but the same piece notes that tribe’s homepage was down, 
and by 2017, tribe announced that it was “working out options” for a new site host.
Neglect is not good for a social network. In 2018, a reddit conspiracy group with a very elaborate Clinton Foundation theory posted verifiable Wayback 
Machine screenshots of pedophilic threads from the “sick n’ twisted” tribe circa 2016, which has stuck, still, to tribe.net’s Google results. Now that 
it’s 2010, your auditorium of Facebook friends includes a guy you met at a bar and various other...acquaintances. This was the impetus for the 
50-friends-only mobile app Path, which co-founders David Morin (of Facebook) and Shawn Fanning and Dustin Mierau (of Napster) based on the findings of 
anthropologist Robin Dunbar, that people can generally have between 40 and 60 close friends and family. (According to the New York Times, Dunbar’s research 
was “a popular topic of discussion” amongst social network developers at the time.) In 2012, Path broadened the friend limit to 150, aka “Dunbar’s Number,” 
representing a person’s maximum number of stable relationships. Path called itself a “personal network.”
Path was “red-hot”, reaching 1.5 million downloads in the first three weeks; after three months, the founders reportedly declined a $100 million offer 
from Google, and by 2013 it was reportedly valued at $500 million. A year after Facebook had just dethroned Myspace, Path was a bonafide Facebook “competitor.”
Path lost some of its vibey goodwill in 2012, when it admitted to the then-taboo practice of pulling contacts from users’ phone books, including 
those of its early adopters under the age of 13, resulting in an $800,000 FTC fine. In 2014, on the brink of failure, Path increased the friend limit to 500. 
In 2015, the Korean communications company Daum Kakao bought Path for an undisclosed sum. In 2018, Path shut down.
In 2012, Kirsten Bischoff, co-founder of the micro social network HATCHEDit, warned that Path could easily become another “excellent tool that was ahead of 
its time,” unable to compete with Facebook’s exploding user base–at that point, gaining about 50 million active monthly users per quarter. Six years later, 
Bischoff’s prediction came true in a eulogy by Gizmodo’s Harrison Weber.
Path had some other good ideas: a text service with a person on the other end who would call your local businesses to answer questions like whether a 
restaurant has reservations or Home Depot has a part. And you can still experience a small portion of Path today on Facebook, which has a near-identical 
version of Path’s “Reactions.” The app for college students that quickly turned into a Black Mirror episode. Yik Yak, the anonymous messaging app designed 
by frat brothers Tyler Droll and Brooks Buffington with campuses in mind, allowed users to broadcast posts within a five-mile radius without creating a 
username. It soon became a scourge on 1,600 schools, terrorized by Yik Yak-borne threats: bomb threats which led to multiple lockdowns and evacuations, a 
threat of a “Virginia Tech 2.0,” threats by white students to kill black students, threats to rape and “euthanize” feminist students, and general cruelty 
and mockery encouraging suicide. Several schools banned it, subpoenas and court orders were issued, federal complaints were filed against schools, and Yik Yak 
had to disable the app near high schools and middle schools altogether.
Yik Yak briefly dominated the tide of anonymous messaging apps like Whisper, Secret, and Formspring; in September 2014, it peaked the third-most-downloaded 
iOS app with 1.8 million monthly downloads. By the same time the following year, it had shrunk to 125,000 per month. It finally shut down in 2017. Ello was 
the Rem Koolhaas building of social media, in all of its elite minimalist beauty. Seven self-described “well-known artists and designers” of the studio 
Berger & Föhr manifested an invite-only anti-Facebook, its bare white walls uncluttered by ads, intended for high-resolution photos and dainty sans-serif text. 
The boutique network happened to coincide with growing anxiety around Facebook’s invasive ad targeting, and they launched in 2014 with the edict “You Are Not a 
Product”–although the trade-off was that you had to be accepted. Sign-up requests surged a few months later with Facebook’s “real name” policy crackdown and 
ensuing LGBTQ exodus. At its peak, one Ello co-founder reported that they were getting 34,000 invite requests per hour.
So many people wanted to join that Ello frequently had to put requests on hold to handle the volume, and it was buggy. That’s not surprising, since 
Ello was still in beta mode and manned by a team of designers who weren’t collecting ad revenue or subscription fees as it was going viral. At the time, 
UX product designer Bona Kim wrote that broken functions, a squirrelly style sheet, incompatibility with mobile, and unclear hierarchy of information at 
the expense aesthetic “simplicity” made it maddeningly unusable.
Fair enough — from the beginning, Ello said that they never intended to be a Facebook replacement.
They’ve since redesigned to with a more accessible aesthetic which reads like a fashion brand. You can sign up without an invite now, though. 
Google tried and tried and tried and tried and tried, but it can’t get a social network going. After it attempted to buy Friendster for $30 million, 
Google launched Orkut, shortly after Myspace and just before Facebook. And like so many social media founders, Orkut’s eponymous Google software engineer 
Orkut Büyükkökten seems to have dreamed it up as a dating site, or, describing it to the New Yorker in 2004: “a good matrix for romance.” Since I was never 
on the site, I defer to the New Yorker’s description:
“New Orkut members fill out pastel-blue forms: favorite TV shows, career skills, perfect first date, bedroom contents. They upload photographs of themselves 
in alluring or alarming poses. They find “Communities” to join: Photography (3,449 members), Belgian Beer (114 members), Kosher Roommates (“for coping or 
recovering roommates of Kosher adherents”; 3 members). If the right Community doesn’t exist, they’re free to found a new one. They can rate their friends, 
relying on an ancient system of hieroglyphs—smiley faces, ice cubes, and hearts, which stand, respectively, for trustworthiness, coolness, and sexiness.“ 
“They can rate their friends, relying on an ancient system of hieroglyphs—smiley faces, ice cubes, and hearts, which stand, respectively, for trustworthiness, 
coolness, and sexiness.” Over the next decade, Orkut never took off in the US but was huge in Brazil and India, at one point, claiming 27 million members 
to Facebook’s 4.2 million. Orkut ostensibly fulfilled the same basic needs, but observers/analysts/users attributed Facebook’s dominance to a number of 
factors: Facebook had more games, the feed, the like button or notifications, a more “professional” look, mutual friends , and cultivated a following 
of international students and “professionals” who brought Facebook back to India. In 2011, Facebook reportedly surpassed Orkut in Brazil. In his farewell 
post, Büyükkökten wrote that Orkut had “a community of 300 million members” and invited them to move to his new network, “hello.”
As for Google... Google’s next stab was a dreary jumble of boxes evoking a digital fulfillment center. By all accounts, it was an attempt to integrate 
features that Facebook, LinkedIn, and the iPhone have cornered (like location sharing and automatic cloud storage for photos), but—with dropdown menus 
organizing your people into “friends,” “family,” and “acquaintances,” further catalogued into the even more confusing “circles”—it felt like an 
unimaginative robot’s idea of socializing. Or, as Google+ UI designer Morgan Knutson called it in a postmortem tweetstorm, a ”god forsaken piece of shit.”
In a lengthy thread, Morgan described siloed teams under corporate bureaucracy which conceptualized networking as “the social graph”:
“Vic [Gundotra’s] product vision was fear-based. ‘Google built the knowledge graph, and Facebook swooped in and built the social graph. 
If we don’t own the social graph then we can’t claim to have indexed ALL the world’s data.’” Plus, it was more overtly unsettling than Facebook 
in the same way that your gmail avatar started popping up in the upper right hand corner of YouTube and your Chrome browser. That’s because, as 
the New York Times reported in 2014 (even then, calling it a “ghost town”), Google Plus was basically an attempt to collect a central dataset for all 
of the stuff you were doing across all Google services; at one point, you couldn’t set up a gmail account or comment on YouTube without setting up Google 
Plus. In the words of Google Plus project management VP Bradley Horowitz, it “gives Google that common understanding of who you are.”
On October 8th, 2018, the same day the Wall Street Journal reported that Google Plus had exposed hundreds of thousands of user data for years, Google 
announced that it would shut down the service in August due to “low usage and engagement.” Additional data was exposed from 5.2 million accounts during 
a November software update, and Google started deleting profiles in April.
Maybe this time?? The video-sharing app Vine was less of a social network and more of a microblogging platform like its owner, Twitter, but for a while, 
Vine dominated the internet’s imagination, and its links populated all networks. The six-second loop format generated a new medium for comedy and activism, 
most memorably, for work by creators of color.
In 2015, writing about the full-blown cultural universe created by black Viners, journalist Hannah Giorgis observed that the Twitter-embeddable fast-paced 
loops meant you saw a lot more people, faster, in a rhythmic format conducive to “percussive precision” that’s lost in longer YouTube vlogs. “And six 
seconds isn’t necessarily enough time to give backstory, to explain your punch line (or yourself) to viewers who don’t already have the context they need 
to understand,” she added. That description goes as much for a cultural sensation started with a child ballerina dancing to “do it for the vine!” as it 
does for Jus Reign’s parody questions about his turban, backwards handsprings through a Krispy Kreme, and singing on a counter at WalMart. 
The speed and ease of posting six-second clips, before the invention of Periscope and Instagram video, also made it a critical tool for activists. 
Protests erupted around the country after St. Louis city alderman Antonio French posted police surrounding Michael Brown’s body on Vine; the subsequent 
nationwide uprising was Vined and compiled into an all-Vine documentary. The 2013 bombing outside the U.S. Embassy in Turkey, anti-refugee hostility in 
Europe, the enormity of the Umbrella Movement, and 2013 protests in Brazil–all Vined.
And a potato flew around a room, the Apple Store woman yelled, and artists created art. Logan Paul was also there.
Then Vine shut down. Generally journalists gleaned that it just couldn’t compete with all the other similar video services; 
Vine’s owner Twitter had just undergone a round of layoffs, and Facebook and Instagram were just unrolling video functions. A former 
executive told the Verge that “Instagram video was the beginning of the end.” Vine gave users advance notice and tools to download their stuff, 
but it left a generation of stories riddled with dead links."

"content": "Summer brings with it a certain set of rites and rituals — and everyone’s are personal and unique. 
For our summer-long ode to the season, T has invited writers to share their own. Here, the writer Chia-Chia Lin describes the fruit 
blitz her family experiences every year.
My husband gorges on bursting plums over the sink — five or six at a time, several times a day. He’s trying his best to help me. 
Summer is a fraught time for both of us.
Crowded into our small backyard are seven fruit trees: apples, pears, three kinds of plums. The trees are old, their branches brittle, 
but they’re brazenly fertile in their golden years. If left unpicked, fruit will thud to the grass every minute or two, like a slow, hard pulse. 
I can’t stand the sound: the ruthless ticking, the reminder of what I haven’t accomplished. Overnight, raccoons will host bacchanals; in the morning, 
every fallen fruit will be missing exactly one bite, and there will be paw prints in the soft plums. The air smells of fermentation.
My discomfort with wastefulness is lodged deep, a vestigial organ. At night, when my desk work is done and my son is sleeping, I sweat over bubbling, 
spitting jams in the kitchen. Inside the oven are plum cobblers, apple pies, pear muffins, apple rings. Once, my hand-cranked apple peeler sent me to 
urgent care. It’s a frantic season, with deadlines dictated by the speed of decay. I give my homely creations away, but I know they might end up in the 
trash; everyone is trying to eat less sugar. We invite children over — they love plucking things from trees — but I worry about their hauls. Will they be 
tossed for blemishes? My poor, ugly, old-fashioned fruit. Sometimes I fantasize about the trendier Californian fruits, the persimmons and figs and pluots. 
These months, I’m often on the ladder, harvesting. Through the leaves I have a view into neighbors’ yards. It’s the season of spying. The houses here are 
small and close; just a few feet off the ground, I can see five backyards. Our favorite neighbors are adding an extension — they have two adult sons who 
can’t move out, this being the Bay Area, and I watch as three generations of their family slowly hand-dig a new foundation and put up framing by themselves. 
Behind us, a young couple — newer to the neighborhood than we are — has torn out their yard to install garden beds. To make room for their chosen crops, 
they’ve cut down a plum tree. Both my parents and in-laws have tried to move here, to a 700-square-foot house like ours, but their life savings and paid-off 
houses in other states are insufficient trade. Half this neighborhood is digging in, rooting itself deeper in order to stay. The other half — including me — 
plays a part in its “transition.” On the ladder, I’m eye-level with a thousand pounds of fruit. Soon it will rain down. I am living in abundance.
Community harvest organizations will pick your fruit and bring it to shelters, but I get the sense they’re overloaded. One website encourages me to 
share my bounty with friends and neighbors. “Consider preserving,” it says. In fact, I have. I’ve lost sleep over my canning methods and possible 
contamination. Every year, I revisit my anxieties about preserving fruit, preserving our yard, preserving our community, or at least not poisoning it. 
My husband scoops half a jar of jam onto his toast.
Planes fly very low here, and a train rattles our windows from a block away. Our lot, with its view of enormous, deafening vehicles, is a dreamland 
for my 1-year-old son. He is always outside. He drops sugar plums into his sand bucket. This summer, before I knew he could even climb, I turned around 
and saw him beaming on the highest rung of the ladder. He wobbled atop our paradise."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-06T10:00:00Z",
"content": "A defining feature of Facebook’s approach to product development is its ruthlessness, which often manifests as a kind of shamelessness. If good taste ever dictates that Facebook stay out of a product, history shows that it’s likely to wade right in. There are, for example, all the times that the company copied Snapchat. Or there was the development of the always-listening Portal video phone, which was delayed by the onset of one privacy scandal and still managed to launch during another one.
Today, with federal agencies investigating whether the company’s tight integration between its family of products represents anti-competitive behavior, Facebook released in the United States a new service that moves to further knit them all together. It’s called Facebook Dating, and I wrote about it at The Verge:
Nearly a year after it began testing in Colombia, Facebook Dating is now available in the United States. The product, which is available to users 18 and older, will appear as a new tab within the Facebook mobile app. People who opt in to Dating can create a profile that’s separate from their main Facebook profile with one tap and meet potential romantic partners among their friends of friends — or, if that makes you uncomfortable, completely outside of your existing friend network.
Facebook says it will suggest matches for you based on preferences you express when you create your profile, along with your interests and Facebook activity. The app, which borrows many design elements from the dating app Hinge, allows you to send a “like” and a corresponding message to any profile you encounter on the service.
The most notable thing about Facebook Dating from a regulatory point of view is likely the way it takes advantage of at least five pillars of the company. (This doesn’t always work, as the New York Times reported today in a new investigation into Facebook romance scams.) It uses your Facebook friend graph and profile to find you matches and verify the authenticity of your account. It lets you find romantic partners among people who are in the same Facebook groups, or attending the same Facebook events, that you are. It encourages you coordinate your plans on Messenger.
And finally, with the US launch, Facebook Dating has added a close integration with Instagram. You can add a module of your recent Instagram photos to your dating profile, and eventually, you’ll be able to post Instagram stories there as well.
Ever since we learned in January that Facebook intends to unify its messaging products under a single banner, it has been clear that the company has been in a race against time. Its mission is to dissolve every possible boundary between WhatsApp, Instagram, and the flagship app, so that if regulators try to force them to spin those out into separate companies, they can complain that it’s simply impossible. If Facebook succeeds, there will be no real “Instagram” or “WhatsApp” to speak of — there will simply be Facebook, available in a handful of different flavors.
In any case, regulation was not the main theme in coverage of Facebook dating today. Instead the theme was, as you might expect, privacy. The company put up a separate blog post intended to address privacy concerns about Dating, but not everyone was satisfied. (Brian Menegus in Gizmodo: “Oh god. Oh no. Please do not do this.”)
And some questions about Dating went unanswered. Here’s Brian Feldman in New York:
Facebook was adamant about how a Dating profile is separate from a user’s main FB profile: Friends aren’t shown as potential matches, and you can preemptively block people. The fact that someone is using Facebook Dating is kept siloed; your Facebook life and your Facebook Dating life are supposedly separate. But under the surface, it seems as if every part of the service is integrated with Facebook’s other properties, which in turn gives Facebook more personal data to potentially target users with ads. New tactics, same old objective.
At the time of this article’s publication, Facebook had not responded to a few simple yes-or-no questions. It’s not clear whether Facebook will use data gathered through the dating service for ad targeting. It’s also not clear whether messages sent between Dating users are end-to-end encrypted (though Facebook has publicly stated its intention to implement encryption on all of its messaging services). But even if Facebook harvests no bits of personal information from the use of its dating service, the thing is designed to get people to use the other parts of Facebook that do harvest info.
On balance, I suppose the privacy concerns about Facebook Dating are better grounded than concerns over competition. Dating apps are one of the most competitive spaces in the tech industry, with multiple highly popular new networks popping up each year. (In the end almost all of them are bought by Match Group, which owns Match.com, Tinder, and OKCupid, among many others.)
But then — social networking seemed pretty competitive when Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp, too. Facebook Dating is now available in 20 countries, and can bootstrap its own growth by promoting itself in one of the most popular apps in the world — while further enmeshing itself with Instagram. (Dating apps like Tinder and Hinge let you integrate with Instagram as well — but will that always be the case? Will Instagram stories come to them, too?)
And for the moment, it’s ad-free and doesn’t require in-app purchases to use any of its features. That’s a luxury that smaller products simply can’t afford.
As a product, Facebook Dating strikes me as well designed and likely quite useful. (It has already produced marriages in some of the countries where it operates, product manager Nathan Sharp told me.) But as a story about competition, it’s another area where Facebook’s many strengths could crowd out competitors over time. If I were mounting an antitrust investigation against the company, it’s a product I’d take a very close look at."

"content": "As rumors swirl about Apple’s plans to launch a Tile  competitor, Tile today announced it’s teaming up with Google  to make it easier for users to locate their lost items using their Android devices and others using Google Assistant. For the uninitiated, Tile is a small hardware accessory that you can attach to items like keys, purses, bags, wallets and more, which can then be tracked using a combination of Bluetooth technology and the wider network of Tile users running the companion app on their phone.
The newly announced Google Assistant integration will make it possible for Google Assistant users to use voice commands to ring the Tile attached to the missing item. This is supported by way of Tile’s “direct ring” technology, which allows the platform to directly connect with, then ring, the lost item.
The Google Assistant integration will be similar to using any other smart home Action through the Assistant, Tile says, and will launch later this year.
“This is big news for Tile customers,” said CJ Prober, CEO of Tile, in a statement. “If you were to lose or misplace your wallet, remote, backpack – anything, Google will soon join your personal search party with a simple voice command.”
Tile’s announcement of Google Assistant integration comes at an interesting time.
Apple, which is hosting its iPhone event next week, has been found to be developing its own Tile competitor. Recently, code referencing a new tab labeled “Items” in iOS 13’s “Find My” app was also discovered, hinting at a forthcoming launch.
It’s unclear, of course, when Apple plans to actually unveil this hardware. But Tile, apparently, is looking to get ahead of any such announcement with its news for Android and Google Assistant users.
Tile has grown to become one of the top makers of Bluetooth-powered lost-item trackers on the market, with 22 million sold in 2018 and a user base that’s locating more than 5 million items daily using its platform across 230 countries and territories around the world.
The company has since expanded beyond its consumer devices to provide location tracking to more products by way of partnerships with BLE chipmakers and other manufacturers.
As of today, that list also includes Sennheiser, which launched its new Momentum Wireless around-ear headphones (339 EUR) at the IFA consumer electronics show in Berlin today. The headphones will ship with Tile’s Community Fine technology built-in, so users can locate them if they become misplaced, lost or stolen.
Tile now has more than 20 partnerships with the addition of Sennheiser, the company says."

"content": "Streaming music subscriptions continue to drive the U.S. music industry’s growth and revenues, according to a new report from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) released this week. The organization said total music revenue grew 18% to $5.4 billion in the first half of 2019, with streaming music accounting for 80% of industry revenues. The report also noted the number of paid subscriptions topped 60 million in the U.S. for the first time. Streaming revenues grew 26% to $4.3 billion in the first half of the year.
This broad figure includes paid versions of Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music and others, as well as digital radio service revenues like those from Pandora, Sirius XM and other internet radio, plus ad-supported streaming like YouTube, Vevo and the ad-supported version of Spotify. Meanwhile, paid subscription streaming is continuing to grow, too, said the RIAA. Year-over-year, paid subscriptions grew 31% to reach $3.3 billion and remain the biggest growth driver for industry revenues.
In the first half of 2019, paid subscriptions made up 62% of all U.S. industry revenues and 77% of U.S. streaming music revenues. The number of paid subscriptions to full on-demand streaming services grew 30% to 61.1 million in the first half of the year, at an average pace of more than 1 million new subscriptions per month.
This doesn’t include the “Limited Tier” subscriptions like Pandora Plus or that Echo-only subscription to Amazon Music, for example, where various factors limit access to a full catalog across devices or restrict some on-demand features. This category saw $482 million in revenues, up 39% from the year prior.
“Thanks to that breakneck growth, plus continued modest drops in digital downloads and new physical sales, streaming now generates 80% of music business revenues and has fundamentally reshaped how fans find, share, and listen to the songs and artists they love,” wrote RIAA chairman & CEO Mitch Glazier, about the new figures. Ad-supported on-demand services grew 25% year-over-year to $427 million, while digital radio service grew 5% to $552 million in the first half of 2019.
However, the gains made by streaming were somewhat offset by declines in digital downloads, as Glazier noted.
Revenues in this category fell 18% to $462 million in the first half of the year, with digital track sales down 16% year-over-year and digital album revenues down 23%. Overall, digital download only accounted for 8.6% of total industry revenues. Physical product revenues grew 5% to $485 million in the first half of 2019, but the RIAA attributed this to a reduction in returns."

"content": "The Guardian is reporting that internal documentation governing Apple’s voice assistant, Siri, was rewritten to specifically avoid the word feminism. The company told the Guardian “[o]ur approach is to be factual with inclusive responses rather than offer opinions.”
The opinion here being... feminism is okay. Presumably, the employees of Apple have no beef with feminism. While the Cupertino giant, like most tech companies, has a leadership team that is largely white and male it is likely okay with women being treated equally to men, and hopefully, internal policies reflect that. Hopefully Apple doesn’t pay men more money for doing the same work as women and hopefully it has a generous family leave policy that doesn’t put the onus of childcare on people who identify as women.
But according to documents leaked to the Guardian, when it comes to Siri, Apple is extremely averse to using the word feminism—treating it as taboo a word as fuck.
It was previously reported by the Guardian that a small sample of customer interactions with Siri was sent to contractors for review to further improve Siri. Today’s report notes that contractors were reviewing 7 million different audio files gathered from iPads, with plans to review approximately the same amount of clips for five other sources including “cars, bluetooth headsets, and AppleTV remotes.” That would be over 42 million Siri clips reviewed if the program had not been shut down last month.
When the program was active these “graders” would listen to clips sent from devices when Siri was activated and work to better improve Siri’s response to questions. To help with the task the graders were given guidelines by Apple, which were last updated in June of 2018. The guidelines gave graders three tasks: “don’t engage,” “deflect,” and “inform.”
According to the Guardian, these guidelines also directed graders to specifically avoid the word “feminism”. In reference to the word feminism, the guidelines reportedly said: “Siri should be guarded when dealing with potentially controversial content.”
So if you ask Siri if she is a feminist the voice assistant responds with “I am a believer in equality, and treating people with respect.” Which is the line you usually get from people ill-informed on feminism, like that one roommate I had in college who instead identified as a “humanist”, or the line you get from people who purposely avoid the use of the word because they feel it’s reserved for “misandrists” and “woman supremacist” and “feminazis.”
To identify as a feminist is, of course, to merely acknowledge that all people are equal but that society is currently inequal. It’s a fairly small ask and the word has been deeply politicized. It is frustrating to see Apple perpetuate the politicization of the word and use a tool, designed to sound like a helpful woman, to do so. Yet Apple is a company that will shy away from controversy because, you know, it’s a publically traded company and companies have to make money and making money can often mean pissing off as few people as possible.
Apple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment but we’ll update this post when it does.
Just this week The Hollywood Reporter claimed Apple canceled a show for its new TV+ service because it was too dark and not focused enough on the friendship between two Vietnam vets who embark on a murder spree. There have also been reports that other shows were canceled for being too violent, or tinkered with to avoid too darkly comedic a tone. The company also contracts the construction of devices to Foxconn—where employees are regularly abused—and relies on rare minerals that come at the cost of human lives in Asia and Africa. Heck, Tim Cook even meets with Trump to discuss trade and business—despite Trump’s trade war with China, terrible statements after Charlottesville, attacks on Muslim immigrants, and inability to remember Cook’s actual name.
Apple telling Siri it can’t say the word feminist, except when defining it, isn’t surprising, its just kind of disappointing."

"content": "We’re days away from Apple’s big annual iPhone party. It’s safe to assume we’re about to learn a whole lot more about this year’s models. But what else is there to learn? This Apple event doesn’t have the massive groundswell of hype September Apple events usually do. We know we’ll get phones with a big camera bump that will probably be as divisive as the notch, and we know that Apple is rolling out its new TV+ service in October, so there’s bound to be some news about that. What else could there be?
The event kicks off Tuesday, September 10, at 10 a.m. ET/1 p.m. PT. I’ll be at the show in Cupertino, and we’ll be liveblogging the whole thing starting about an hour before.
Here’s what we think we know about what’s coming. As noted earlier this week, we’re probably not getting an iPhone SE until next year. But that’s okay because it seems like we’ll be getting three new phones. The previous generation models were called the XR, XS, and XS Max, with the “X” pronounced “ten” in each case. The biggest mystery related to the phones might be their names. X1 is a possibility. So is 11, or XI.
As in 2018, there will be one phone with a 6.1-inch LCD, as well as 5.8-inch and 6.5-inch OLED phones. The OLED phones are also expected to come with a telephoto, wide-angle, and super-wide-angle cameras on the back, and be half a millimeter thicker than the previous models according to Bloomberg. These would be the first triple camera phones from Apple—nearly 18 months after Huawei launched the first triple camera phone, the P20 Pro. Apple’s has felt like its been lagging in the camera department, especially in the last year. Huawei launched the P20 Pro in April 2018, and Google released the innovative Night Sight feature back in November 2018. Both features took computational photography to impressive new places.
As before, the LCD phone will likely cost less. It will only have a telephoto and wide-angle camera, according to an earlier Bloomberg report. That would still be an upgrade over the XR, which only has a single camera on the back. All three phones will have a new A13 processor.
MacRumors and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo both claim that all three phones will supposedly drop the glossy finish and opt for a matte finish that could be more durable. But the matte finish shouldn’t disrupt the phones’ ability to charge wirelessly, and Kuo claims that the phones will also charge AirPods in a pinch.
Face ID will also supposedly be improved, according to Kuo. Bloomberg and Kuo both claim Touch ID will almost certainly not be present.
9to5Mac claims Apple will kill 3D Touch as it reportedly contributes to phone thickness. In its stead, we should see a new haptic system based on the one first introduced iPhone XR.
New Apple TV: 
TV+, Apple’s new streaming service, and Arcade, its new game subscription service, are both expected to launch in the fall. So it makes sense that the company would launch a new Apple TV that can be used to enjoy both services.
The TV typically uses processors deployed in relatively recent iPhones. The current high-end Apple TV, the TV 4K, uses an A10 processor from 2016. According to MacRumors, leaker @never_released claims a new TV will be launched this year and have the A12 processor launched in last years iPhones.
TV+ Pricing: 
We have a good idea of how much Apple Arcade will cost ($5) thanks to a 9to5Mac report, but there’s still a big question mark when it comes to TV+. Bloomberg reported it will cost $10 a month. Which makes sense given that’s the pricing of News+ and Apple Music.
The service will be competing with more mature fare, like Netflix, and new services with enormous back catalogs like Disney+ and HBO Max. It will also be dealing with a widely reported issue of puritanical self-censorship. In the absence of really compelling content or a deep catalog, aggressive pricing might be one of the levers Apple can pull to get people to buy in.
With the expected TV news, it makes sense that Apple would drop the price at the Apple event. And who knows, it might even tell us when these services are going to launch.
Ceramic Watches: The Apple Watch got a significant update in 2018 with a splashy new ECG feature. So far there aren’t many rumors suggesting the Watch will change much in its 2019 refresh. Bloomberg even claims the changes will primarily have to do with the OS, which was already announced back at WWDC.
The only thing that seems both likely and notable is that there could be a new ceramic model.
16-inch MacBook: 
We’ve been hearing rumors of a 16-inch Macbook for a while now. Digitimes claims it will fit the same dimensions as the current 15-inch MacBook Pro, which would likely mean Apple is finally embracing super-slim bezels on its laptops.
An IHS Market report published by Forbes claims the display will have a 3,072 by 1,920 resolution, while 9t05Mac seems to think it will share the same H-series 9th-gen Intel processor that the current 15-inch MacBook Pro has. Ming-Chi Kuo also claims that it will launch this fall and include new key switches.
But it’s not clear if the laptop will launch at the iPhone event or be reserved for an event later this fall instead.
New iPads: 
The idea of a second event starts to make sense when you consider that Apple is also planning to launch new iPads. So the September event could be for iPhones, Watches, and TVs, and a theoretical future event could be for laptops, tablets—and maybe even a proper launch for the new Mac Pro.
The $330 iPad got a lovely refresh in March 2018, but rumors point to a new iPad, which expands the screen size from 9.7 inches to 10.2 inches. Bloomberg claims that the iPad should come this fall.
It also claims that the iPad Pro will get a refresh too—but that will likely just be updated cameras and processors. This one’s supported by regulatory filings spied earlier this year."

"content": "With its flagship iPhone event just a few days away, it appears that Apple is getting a little nervous about recent reports regarding the state of its lauded security features. On Friday, it took the unusual step of publishing a blog post to refute some recent claims about its operating system made by Google researchers and to clarify the impact its failures have had on users around the globe.
In recent years, Apple has seen two big strategic openings to keep its business alive and growing: services and privacy. Few companies can hold their head as high as Apple when it comes to protecting users’ data, and even fewer can say that they don’t monetize user data to a significant degree. But Apple’s experienced a few security black eyes recently, and the company published a brief blog post on Friday that accuses the team at Google’s Project Zero of “stoking fear” about iPhone security with a report it issued at the end of August.
Project Zero and Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) found 14 vulnerabilities in Apple’s products that were being exploited by a group of watering hole websites that were designed to indiscriminately target iPhone users and take over control of their devices. Apple hasn’t disputed the existence of the vulnerabilities, and it claimed that they were patched back in February. But yesterday, new reports came out that outlined the broad strokes of an operation by the Chinese Government to track its persecuted minority Uighur population in part by hacking iPhone and Android devices. It appears that the potential for confusion has given Apple motivation to clarify that the Project Zero report and Chinese Government hacks are related and that it feels Google’s report was unfair.
For one thing, Apple says that it was “already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs,” when Google’s researchers first came to them to point out the vulnerabilities. Can’t pwn Apple when they already know they’ve been pwned. In fact, Apple claims the issue was resolved “just 10 days after we learned about it.”
Apple also said in its post that “all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not ‘two years’ as Google implies.” The word “implied” is actually generous. Google’s exact language in its report claimed that a group of sites was involved in “making a sustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years.” But Google seems to be basing its number on how long the websites existed, and Apple is going with how long they were “operational.”
Apple also clarified that “the attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community.”
What may be the most egregious failing on Google’s part was the fact that it only mentioned Apple in its report, but it has subsequently come to light that Android and Windows systems were being targeted by the same hackers. When asked for comment on Apple’s post today, a Google spokesperson told Gizmodo:
Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies. We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.
Cutting through the corporate-speak in that statement, it is important to acknowledge that the Project Zero crew does great work, and there’s no reason to believe that their work is motivated by malice. It’s also worth emphasizing that Apple’s reputation for making secure products has been earned by making secure products. What’s at issue here is who will have the best reputation for security in the future, and the answer is up for grabs.
Earlier this week, Wired reported that Android’s security is getting so good that the price of finding exploits for the open-source mobile OS is skyrocketing. Zerodium, which buys and sells so-called zero-day exploits, is the only outfit of its kind that releases an annual price list for discovering secret software vulnerabilities. This year, Android zero-days topped the iPhone for the first time, fetching a $2.5 million price tag “for a so-called zero-click hacking technique that fully, silently takes over an Android phone with no interaction from the target user,” Wired wrote. Someone who discovers the same level of risk in iOS would reportedly bring home $500,000 less in profits.
The reward for discovering certain iMessage hacks was cut in half by Zerodium. One has to surmise that the laws of supply and demand are working in full effect—the more iMessage vulnerabilities that are being reported, the less valuable they are. And the most recent major report of flaws in the iMessage client came in July from, you guessed it, Project Zero.
The most embarrassing public disclosure of a recent security fuckup by Apple came last month when it issued an iOS patch that omitted bug fixes that it had patched in earlier updates. The floodgates were suddenly thrown open and enthusiasts were able to issue a jailbreak before Apple fixed it—an illicit practice that Apple had managed to make all but extinct over the last few years.
Apple is still great at security. And it will likely tell you that over and over at next week’s iPhone event. The problem for Apple is that Android is getting really good at security too, and Google will likely tell you that over and over when it releases the next batch of Pixel phones. Maor Shwartz, an experienced independent security vulnerability researcher, told Wired that the open-source nature of Android is finally paying off, and the number of eyes on its code has resulted in fewer vulnerabilities “because a lot of them have been patched.”
The problem with making a big deal out of having strong security as a business strategy is no one is safe, and everything can change in an instant. Apple’s walled garden has protected it for years, as has the prospect of finding a nasty bug for big money and endless glory. That environment seems to be changing. And when Tim Cook takes the stage next week to tout the latest and greatest way to store your dick pics, his case will be a little weaker. But the good news is that’s mostly due to the other guys getting better."

"content": "New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a multi-state antitrust investigation into Facebook on Friday, applying a new layer of pesky regulatory scrutiny to the scandal-ridden social network.
The launch of the investigation comes amid greater federal and state oversight of major technology companies, including Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple. The state-level probe will examine a wide range of Facebook’s activities, including its handling of user data, its effects on consumer choice, and the price of advertising, New York’s attorney general said in a statement.
“Even the largest social media platform in the world must follow the law and respect consumers. I am proud to be leading a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general in investigating whether Facebook has stifled competition and put users at risk,” James said. “We will use every investigative tool at our disposal to determine whether Facebook’s actions may have endangered consumer data, reduced the quality of consumers’ choices, or increased the price of advertising.”
Facebook did not immediately respond to our request for comment.
In addition to James, attorneys general from Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, and the District of Columbia will be on the investigation’s leadership team, according to James’ office.
This probe adds to action at the federal level that began in earnest this summer. On July 23, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it has begun an expansive investigation into “market-leading online platforms” to determine whether they “are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers.”
The following day, Facebook confirmed that it is facing antitrust probes from both the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. That revelation came on the heels of the FTC’s announcement earlier the same day that it had fined Facebook a record $5 billion for privacy violations in part stemming from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. While the Republican-led FTC characterized its settlement with Facebook as “historic” and increased restrictions on the company’s privacy and transparency practices as “sweeping,” the penalty was seen as inadequate by Democrats.
State-level action against major tech firms is reportedly not limited to Facebook. Google is also expected to face an investigation from “more than half” the state attorneys general, according to the Washington Post. That inquiry will reportedly be announced on Monday.
Despite the flurry of attention from regulators, major tech companies have yet to suffer any lasting consequences that disrupt their businesses or meaningfully cut into their bottom lines. Indeed, Facebook’s stock price jumped 1.8 percent after the FTC revealed its fine. Maybe this one will stick?"

"content": "More than a week after researchers at Google detailed one of the most serious iPhone exploits in recent memory, Apple has responded.
In a statement published Friday, Apple went on the defensive, saying that Google researchers were stoking fear and had exaggerated the seriousness of the attack.
Cupertino's statement comes more than a week after Google's Project Zero researchers published a blog post detailing how malware embedded in specific websites could steal large amounts of personal data off users' iPhones. This included messages, both encrypted and otherwise, real-time GPS locations, and passwords. 
We estimate that these sites receive thousands of visitors per week, Project Zero researcher Ian Beer wrote. Though Beer didn't elaborate on who may have been impacted by the malware, it was subsequently reported that it was a state-sponsored attack targeting China's Uighur Muslims.
In its statement, Apple noted that the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones 'en masse' as described.
The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community, Apple wrote. The company's statement makes no mention of China, where the government has been accused of widespread hacking in order to track the country's Muslim minority community. 
Though the malware could have infected any iPhone that visited the websites in question, Apple said Google overstated the scale of the exploit. Google’s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of “mass exploitation” to “monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,” stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case.
Second, all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not “two years” as Google implies. We fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February — working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it. When Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs.
The company also made a veiled dig at Google's Android operating system, writing, iOS security is unmatched because we take end-to-end responsibility for the security of our hardware and software.
In a statement a Google spokesperson said it stands by its work: We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online.
Apple's response, which comes just days before the launch of its new iPhones, was quickly criticized by many in the security community as being tone deaf.
Alex Stamos, Facebook's former chief security officer who is now a researcher at Stanford University, said the company's response should be graded somewhere between disappointing and disgusting. Disputing Google's correct use of 'indiscriminate' when describing a watering hole attack smacks of 'it's ok, it didn't hit white people,' Stamos tweeted. It is possible that this data contributed to real people being 'reeducated' or even executed."

"content": "Concerns about iOS security have been swirling since Google published a blog that outlined some vulnerabilities it discovered within iOS. Apple fixed these back in February, but that didn't stop the concerns. To reaffirm customers, Apple released a special message outlining exactly what took place with the vulnerabilities while dispelling false information regarding the situation.
In a brief summary of Google's blog, it found malicioius websites were accessing user's phones and stealing privata data like messages, location, photos and more.
Apple's response to it was short but to the point. Its first goal was to curb speculation about how wide this vulnerability really was. In reality, it affected less than a dozen websites. First, the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones en masse as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community. Regardless of the scale of the attack, we take the safety and security of all users extremely seriously.
Google's post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of mass exploitation to monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time, stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case. It then went on to correct some false statements made about the website attacks including how long it lasted.
Second, all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not two years as Google implies. We fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February — working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it.

Apple finished the message with a strong statement on security: Security is a never-ending journey and our customers can be confident we are working for them. It concluded: We will never stop our tireless work to keep our users safe.
As is the case with most issues regarding Apple, they tend to be overblown. This was no different. You can read the complete statement on Apple's site.
Google responded to the Apple's message in a statement to CNBC saying it stands by its in-depth research and its end goal was to understand security vulnerabilities. With neither Apple nor Google backing down, the situation has turned into a he said, she said situation."

But unlike a phone, there isn't that much to tease when it comes to a TV, so in an inspired move, OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has served up a first look at the remote.
The remote is near-identical to the one bundled with Apple TV, with just five buttons joined by a trackpad up top. One of those buttons is for invoking Google Assistant, and the button with the OnePlus logo is likely for the smart hub dashboard that OnePlus is baking into Android TV.
There's also what looks like a USB-C port at the bottom, presumably for connecting a pair of earbuds and charging the remote. The TV is launching sometime later this month, so we will inevitably see more teasers ahead of the launch. Who's ready to see the back panel next week?"

Disney+ will launch with hundreds of movies and television shows for you to feast your eyes on. This means that you'll probably end up watching even when you aren't at home.
This is an easy task since the streaming service will be available on a variety of devices — almost all of them. You'll be able to stream from your phone, Android TV, and even Chromecast. This means that keeping your kids happy during long car rides amd plane trips will be easier than ever, since they'll have access to so much content.
The only catch to this, for the moment, is that there isn't any news about whether there are limitations on older phones or operating systems. There hasn't been much news about how the app will work yet either, but with the launch day in just over two months, hopefully Disney will be announcing more details soon.
What we do know is that Disney+ will be available on Android, iPhones, Chromecast, gaming consoles, and Roku devices. The only big name that seems to have been left out of the equation so far is Amazon Fire TV and Amazon tablets.
Supported devices: 
Android Phones,
Android TV,
Chromecast,
iPhone,
iPad,
Apple TV,
Xbox One,
PlayStation 4,
Desktop web browsers (plugins are unknown),
Android TV based Sony TVs,
Roku streaming players,
Roku TV.
Disney+ is the brand new streaming service from Disney. It will include classic Disney movies, Pixar films, Star Wars, the Marvel universe, Fox, and even National Geographic.
Along with everything that you'll watch in theaters being available to stream, the service will provide a variety of awesome exclusives you won't be able to watch anywhere else. These include shows like The Mandalorian, WandaVision, She-Hulk and plenty more.
How much will Disney+ cost?: 
Disney+ will start at the extra affordable price of just $7 per month, or $70 a year. If you'd prefer to bundle it you can grab a package deal that includes ESPN, and Hulu (with ads) for only $13 each month."

"publishedAt": "2019-09-06T21:35:37Z",
"content": "By now, you're probably tired of reading articles online about Android 10 gesture navigation. It seems like nobody really likes it, Google just can't get it right, and nothing the company can do fixes things. All this is doubly true if you're one of the people who have no problems with the current gesture navigation solution in Android. With this in mind, instead of ranting about a feature that seems like it's unfinished and has no direction, let's talk about what it takes to fix it all once and for all.
Complaining about gestures doesn't help and nobody is listening anyway.: 
For starters, looking at companies like OnePlus or Samsung and saying that there are better gesture-based systems out there isn't helpful here. Those may work alright for the companies in question and people can prefer them over Google's solution, but something like moving about the home screen on your phone or navigating through an app needs to be consistent across the entire platform. You can't expect developers to cater to every individual brand, nor can you expect a consumer to be happy with a new phone if they have to relearn how to use the basics. Navigation needs to be like notifications and the basics need to be the same no matter which brand you buy into.
Another thing to realize is that some gestures need to be more important than others. Seeing which apps are currently running isn't something you'll do nearly as often as swiping back or swiping home. The gestures for these important things need to be easy and work on every screen. Imagine watching a full-screen video or playing a full-screen game and you can't swipe to get the notification shade or to go home, and you'll understand what I'm saying here. To me, Google using either side of the screen as a way to swipe back makes perfect sense because of this, even if it does interfere with the menu for a large percentage of the apps in the Play Store.
All gestures are equal but some are more equal than others.: 
Those apps are things that can be — no, should be — fixed if we're to go buttonless on our phones. Consistent and performant gestures on a phone mean nothing if things don't work the same way when you have an app open. Google can tackle this problem by taking a stance that would be very unpopular, yet necessary — force developers that build apps to follow a set of strict guidelines about where and how navigation points are placed. You don't have to worry about where to put the handles of your swipe back gesture if there is no hamburger menu to worry about. So get rid of hamburger menus.
This sounds harsh, but it's also a reason why companies like Samsung (and Apple, of course) seem to have better success with gestures. Most of the apps on a new Galaxy S10 are built by Samsung and written to work perfectly with the company's gestures. Samsung can't control all the apps in Google Play, but the ones people use everyday work because developers can't afford to let their apps not work on two-thirds of the phones in the world. Those same developers would change how apps work to fit in with Android-wide gestures if they had to, too.
Nobody wants to see google take a heavy hand when it comes to the Play Store. It may be Google's baby and nothing about it is open or free, but having such a great choice and selection is what makes it great. But if Google really wants gestures to work, then it has to do something.
And it can start in its own playground."

"content": "Google's Project Zero last week shared details about multiple serious iOS vulnerabilities that allowed malicious websites to access a victim's phone. There were a total of 14 vulnerabilities that were being exploited, and while those have now been fixed, some of the security holes were abused for several years.
Apple today responded to Google's Project Zero blog post in an effort to address customer concerns with all of the facts.
Apple says the attack was narrowly-focused rather than a broad-based exploit of iPhones as described. Fewer than a dozen websites targeting Uighur Muslims were affected, according to Apple. Further, Apple says that Google created a false impression of mass exploitation, causing fear among iPhone owners.
Google also got the length of the attacks wrong. Apple says the websites were operational for approximately two months rather than two years, with the vulnerabilities fixed 10 days after Apple learned about them. Fixes were already in the works when Google approached Apple.
Apple's full letter is included below:
Last week, Google published a blog about vulnerabilities that Apple fixed for iOS users in February. We've heard from customers who were concerned by some of the claims, and we want to make sure all of our customers have the facts.
First, the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones en masse as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community. Regardless of the scale of the attack, we take the safety and security of all users extremely seriously.
Google's post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of mass exploitation to monitor the private activities of entire populations in real time, stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised. This was never the case.
Second, all evidence indicates that these website attacks were only operational for a brief period, roughly two months, not two years as Google implies. We fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February -- working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it. When Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs.
Security is a never-ending journey and our customers can be confident we are working for them. iOS security is unmatched because we take end-to-end responsibility for the security of our hardware and software. Our product security teams around the world are constantly iterating to introduce new protections and patch vulnerabilities as soon as they're found. We will never stop our tireless work to keep our users safe.
According to Google, the websites in question that targeted iPhone users were able to steal private data like messages, photos, and GPS location in real time with little effort after a visitor went to an infected website.
Google believes thousands of visitors accessed these websites per week over two years, with the vulnerability present in iOS 10, iOS 11, and iOS 12. Apple addressed the issues in iOS 12.1.4 back in February 2019.
In a statement to The Verge, Google said that it stands by its original report despite Apple's comments.
Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies. We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities. We will continue to work with Apple and other leading companies to help keep people safe online."

"content": "Apple vulnerabilities are rare and often worth millions, so it was a revelation when Google disclosed a string of security flaws that allowed for the hacking of any iPhones used to visit certain websites laced with malware. Now Apple is responding to those attacks, offering more details on the scope of the security issues, in a post on Friday.  
On Aug. 30, Google's Project Zero security researchers revealed that they'd found multiple websites with malware that could hack people's iPhones. The malware had the ability to gain full control, stealing photos, messages and location data, and was installed when an iPhone user visited a certain page. The malware was also able to install more malicious apps, as well as harvest passwords and encrypted messages, according to the security researchers. 
Google didn't disclose what websites the malware was hidden on, but Apple provided more details on Friday. 
First, the sophisticated attack was narrowly focused, not a broad-based exploit of iPhones 'en masse' as described. The attack affected fewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community, Apple said in a statement.
The Chinese government has made forceful efforts against its Uighur Muslim population, detaining more than 1 million people in its Xinjiang region. Technology has played a key role in these human rights abuses, including the use of facial recognition to track the population. The Chinese government had also reportedly been forcing visitors at Xinjiang's borders to download malware on devices to scan for files related to Islamic content. On Thursday, Reuters reported that a hacking campaign compromising several telecom companies was also targeting Uighur Muslims.  
Security company Volexity detailed a hacking campaign targeting Uighur Muslims in China on Monday, finding at least 11 websites compromised to infect Android devices and collect similar data. Those websites included pages related to Uighur news and press in Turkey. 
Google said it would continue working with Apple to keep people safe online.
Project Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies. We stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities, a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
Volexity noted that the attacks had possible ties to the security flaws disclosed by Google last week. After the disclosure, sources told TechCrunch that China was potentially behind the attacks targeting Uighur Muslims. 
Apple didn't specifically point to China as being behind these attacks but noted that it was targeting the Uighur population. It also denied that the attacks had been going on for two years and said that the website attacks were active for only two months. 
We fixed the vulnerabilities in question in February -- working extremely quickly to resolve the issue just 10 days after we learned about it. When Google approached us, we were already in the process of fixing the exploited bugs, Apple said in its statement.

The search giant also said it's preparing for scrutiny from state attorneys generals. An official announcement of that probe is expected Monday in Washington, DC. 
The DOJ has asked us to provide information about these past investigations, and we expect state attorneys general will ask similar questions, Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, wrote in a blog post. We have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.
The Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Google's acknowledgement comes as the government has ratcheted up scrutiny of Silicon Valley as a whole. The Justice Deparment in July announced an antitrust probe into the tech industry more broadly, targeting Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Meanwhile, House Democrats in June announced their own investigation into tech giants, meant to explore whether the companies are engaging in anti-competitive conduct.
On Friday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a similar probe into Facebook. The investigation, which will involve other states including Florida, Colorado and Iowa, will focus on Facebook's dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance, James' office said in a statement. 
Google is no stranger to government investigations. Six years ago, the FTC wrapped up a probe of the company looking into allegations of search bias. At the time, the commission decided that Google wasn't violating any antitrust laws.
We look forward to showing how we are investing in innovation, providing services that people want, and engaging in robust and fair competition, Walker wrote on Friday."

Sony says 'door is closed' on Spider-Man returning to MCU
Jeremy Renner asks Sony to give Spider-Man back to Marvel
A deal between Sony, which owns Spidey's movie rights, and Disney-owned Marvel Studios, allowed Tom Holland to play Spider-Man in three Marvel Studios movies in addition to stand-alone films for Sony that featured various Marvel characters.
But with the deal done, Holland's Spidey is going to have to web-crawl through his own universe without the Avengers assembling to help him out.
Will Marvel and Sony ever reunite, even if in some yet-unseen-by-Doctor-Strange future? We can hope. But for now, let's swing through some of Holland's best Spidey moments from the MCU days. (Yes, we're including the two Spider-Man standalone films, which come from Sony but were co-produced with Marvel and are just crawling with Avenger DNA.)
~Underoos!~:
Every American kid who lived through the 1970s and 1980s remembers Underoos, character-patterned underwear that's fun to wear. It probably wasn't the coolest nickname for Iron Man to give Spider-Man in 2016's Captain America: Civil War, but when Iron Man calls him into battle with the new nickname, it's pretty funny. And Spidey grabbing Cap's iconic shield (and later gushing about what a fan he is) only cements that the new kid's not kidding around. Welcome to the MCU, Spider-Man.
~'That's not a hug'~: 
Peter's not an Avenger, Tony warns in 2017's Spider-Man: Homecoming, but if he keeps on keeping on, he might be able to go on another, uh, retreat, as Peter cheerfully dubs the Avengers missions. And then he reaches over to let him out of the car, confusing Peter. It's not a hug, though. They're not there yet.
~'I don't feel so good'~:
Stock up on extra-ply Kleenex for 2018's Avengers: Infinity War. Since everyone who cares has seen it, we can spoil the fact that Thanos turns half of our heroes into dust in the wind. But no one's presumed death is sadder than Peter Parker's. A baby-faced Holland plays a completely credible teenager as he flails against the inevitable, with father figure Tony Stark helpless for once. We don't feel so good either.
~'This is nice'~: 
Spider-Man lives to web-sling again. In 2019's Avengers: Endgame, Thanos' snap is reversed, and Peter Parker comes skipping over to Iron Man to pour out what happened to him since that five-years-ago moment. He's surprised when Tony Stark can't help but hug him, but it's a precious moment, and we don't mean the sappy little statue kind.
~'I'm too busy doing your job'~: 
In 2019's Spider-Man: Far From Home, Parker and pals go on a European vacation. But before they go, the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man helps out the cops by webbing up some bad guys in NYC. One of them asks him the question that's been hanging over the webslinger ever since he lost Tony Stark, saying, You gonna be the next Iron Man now? But Parker doesn't let the reminder of his mentor bring him down, snarking back, Well, no, I don't have time, I'm too busy doing your job. Just one New Yorker jawing at another, Big Apple-style, and it's a nice Spidey moment. We'll hope for more of these if Spidey has to stand alone in future films."

"content": "We all know the struggle of a fickle scale: you weigh yourself after one unhealthy meal and you've gained 5 pounds, only for the blip to even out over the next week. While it's tempting to focus only the number on the scale, it's not a great indicator of how healthy you are because your weight fluctuates hour to hour due to food, salt intake, exercise and even the weather.
Your weight doesn't tell the full story of your health, especially because the number alone doesn't account for how much muscle and fat you have. If you are working out and building muscle, the number on the scale might go up as you gain muscle (which weighs twice as much as fat), even though you are improving your overall health. 
While you shouldn't completely discount the number on the scale, it only tells a very small piece of the story. Instead of staring at your weight every morning, check out these health markers that'll give you a much more complete state of affairs.
~Blood pressure~: 
High blood pressure has been nicknamed the silent killer. And now that I've scared you into paying attention, I'll explain why. When someone has high blood pressure, the force exerted against their artery walls is much larger than it should be. This extra pressure puts strain on your heart and increases your risk of a heart attack, heart disease or stroke. It usually doesn't present obvious symptoms until it's too late, so you have to be proactive in measuring it throughout your life.
The good news is that there are many steps you can take to lower blood pressure before taking medication. Limiting salt intake, drinking less alcohol, quitting smoking and getting more daily exercise have all shown to be effective. 
How to measure: Chances are you don't have a blood pressure monitoring machine at home (although it might be a good idea to get one), so you might have to make a doctor's appointment to check your levels. If you don't have a scheduled checkup soon, some retail drug stores like CVS offer free use of their machines.
Your reading will give you two numbers: the upper one is called systolic pressure and the lower one diastolic. Generally, you want your systolic pressure under 120 and diastolic under 80. You'll want both numbers to fall in line, because if your diastolic reading is in a healthy range and your systolic is elevated, the reading still presents a health risk.
~Resting heart rate~: 
If you don't have time to go to the doctor to get your blood pressure checked, your resting heart rate may give you a clue whether it's too high or not. A study of World Health Organization data showed that elevated resting heart rates are strongly correlated with high blood pressure, and in turn cardiovascular mortality.
A normal resting heart rate is anywhere between 60 and 100 beats per minute, though if you're in really good shape it might be even lower. While a very high resting heart rate, called tachycardia, can be a serious medical emergency, monitoring average levels can give you good indicators to your overall health as well. Resting heart rate tends to rise when you are stressed, exercising less or not getting enough sleep.
How to measure: Measuring yours is as simple as it sounds: find your pulse either on your neck, the inside of your wrist, or even the top of your foot. For the most accurate results, set a timer for 60 seconds and count the total number of beats. I hope I don't have to tell you this, but make sure you're not exercising while measuring your resting heart rate. In fact, do this first thing in the morning before you get out of bed.
~Heart rate recovery~: 
There's another health marker that has to do with your heart: how fast it returns to normal after exercise. Heart rate recovery indicates how good of shape you're in (if you work out a lot, expect recovery to be fast). It also correlates with your risk of cardiovascular disease, including atrial fibrillation, and all-around mortality. This is another health marker you can be proactive about -- with regular cardiovascular exercise (walking, jogging, dancing) you can expect to improve your heart rate recovery in a matter of months.
How to measure: This is another number you can measure at home. First, you need to get your heart rate elevated by working out strenuously. Run, jump, or do jumping jacks to get it up there. If you're reading this at your desk, you can get up and go sprint around the office. I promise your coworkers will know that you're performing a very scientific study. Then, measure your heart rate while you're still breathing heavy. Recover for two minutes, then measure it again. Subtract the first number from the second number, and this is your heart rate recovery.
Generally, you want your heart rate recovery to be in between 22-52 beats per minute, although you're in the clear for major risks if it's anywhere above 12. A heart rate recovery that's  lower than 12 is associated with heart issues and type-2 diabetes.
~Waist-to-hip ratio~: 
While overall levels of body fat are important factors in your health, what may be the most important is how that fat is distributed. The ratio between the circumference of your waist and circumference of your hips is used as an important health marker for obesity-related illnesses. The more fat you carry around your waist (being apple-shaped as opposed to pear-shaped), the higher your risk is for heart disease.
How to measure: The World Health Organization has detailed instructions on how to take these measurements, specifying to use a stretch-resistant measurement tape. The waist measurement is taken at the midpoint between the last rib and the top or your pelvis. The hip circumference is taken at the widest point of the buttocks, with the tape measurement parallel to the floor. Then you divide the first by the second, and voila!
The World Health Organization defines ratios over 0.85 for women and 0.9 for men for being at substantially increased risk for obesity-related illnesses, including metabolic disease and heart disease. 
If your ratio is higher than you'd like, the good news is that it's not permanent. A 2011 study suggested that a diet low in processed foods may lower your waist to hip ratio, so there's an extra point for the benefits of trying to eat healthier.
~Cholesterol levels~: 
Harvard reports that one in every six Americans has high cholesterol, making them twice as likely to develop heart disease. But, cholesterol isn't all bad -- it plays an incredibly important role in your body. It's found in every cell, and plays a vital role in creating the cell membrane that protects all the good stuff inside.
Typically, when people talk about cholesterol, they're usually referring to LDL, or bad cholesterol. There's also HDL, or good, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. 
I'm starting to sound like a broken record, but a healthy diet low in processed food is the best first treatment for high cholesterol. Exercising and quitting smoking also help. Cholesterol naturally rises with age, so if a time machine is ever invented that could be a good bet too. If your levels are still high after trying self-treatment, a doctor can prescribe medicine to help.
How to measure: Head to your doctor and ask to get a blood panel. That will give you a detailed report on all these different levels, and comprehensive guidelines can tell you if any are too high.
~Inflammation~: 
Inflammation is another necessary bodily function that can sometimes go too far. It's a fundamental immune process involving white blood cells. For example, if you cut your finger chopping veggies,  an inflammatory response is in charge of telling white blood cells to go to the injury site and heal it, bringing along that familiar redness and swelling.
Sometimes, though, your own immune system can turn against you. Inflammation isn't a particularly well studied phenomenon, but the Johns Hopkins Health Review reports it's a common factor in several common diseases, such as arthritis, heart disease, and even cancer. 
Inflammation has been linked to a stress response, so if you notice more swelling it could be a good indicator of mental health. Meditation, taking daily walks, and getting better sleep can all help you relieve stress on a daily basis. Another culprit may be your diet, and incorporating more anti-inflammatory foods can help.
How to measure: This health marker is a bit harder to quantify, but if you have too much inflammation, it may show up in your body as redness, swelling and pain around joints. Other indicators include psoriasis (dry, flaky skin), and chronic bloating.

Revenue-based investing: A new option for founders who care about control
Who are the major revenue-based investing VCs?
Should your new VC fund use revenue-based investing?
Why are revenue-based VCs investing in so many women and underrepresented founders?
Should you raise equity venture capital or revenue-based investing VC?
A new wave of revenue-based investors are emerging who are using creative investing structures with some of the upside of traditional VC, but some of 
the downside protection of debt.
I’ve been a traditional equity VC for 8 years, and I’m researching new business models in venture capital. As I’ve learned about this model, I’ve been 
impressed by how these venture capitalists are accomplishing a major social impact goal… without even trying to.
Many are reporting that they’re seeing a more diverse pool of applicants than traditional equity VCs — even though virtually none have a particular focus 
on women or underrepresented founders. In addition, their portfolios look far more diverse than VC industry norms.
For context, revenue-based investing (“RBI”) is a new form of VC financing, distinct from the preferred equity structure most VCs use. RBI normally requires 
founders to pay back their investors with a fixed percentage of revenue until they have finished providing the investor with a fixed return on capital, 
which they agree upon in advance. For more background, see “Revenue-based investing: A new option for founders who care about control“.
I contacted every RBI venture capital investor I could identify, and learned:
John Borchers, Co-founder and Managing Partner of Decathlon Capital, reports that “37% of our portfolio companies would be considered ‘impact’ qualified 
companies. This includes companies that would meet most institutional definitions for impact investing (women, minority, and veteran owned/run businesses, 
including LMI (“Low to Moderate Income”) and CRA (“Community Reinvestment Act”) qualified companies. While we do lots of work in these areas due to the 
attractive opportunity set, we are not an impact investor, and impact qualification is not a criterion that we use in evaluating or funding companies. 
On an organic basis, 13% of our portfolio companies are women-owned or run businesses, while 19% of the companies we work with are minority-owned or run. 
When you look at the composition of the entire founding or executive teams, the number of companies with either a woman or minority in management jumps 
even higher and is north of 50%.”
Indie.VC reports, “…50% of the teams we’ve funded are led by female founders and nearly 20% are led by black founders.”
Lighter Capital reports that they’ve funded companies in 30 states, including well established startup hubs and less mature ecosystems.
According to Derek Manuge, CEO of Corl, in the past 12 months, 500+ companies have applied to Corl for funding. Of the ones who received capital, 
“30% were led by women, and 40% were led by executives of non-Caucasian or of mixed ethnic origin.”
Feenix Partners reports that “35% of our portfolio companies have either a female or minority (non-Caucasian) CEO or Owner.
Michelle Romanow, co-founder and CEO of Clearbanc, says that “We have funded eight times more women than the venture capital industry average – probably 
because we’re not doing meetings, which is an amazing accomplishment, and that’s not because we do different sourcing or anything else. It was just because 
we looked at data.” (Note that Clearbanc has a somewhat different business model than the RBI VCs I list here.)
Founders First Capital is the only RBI VC I’ve identified with a specific focus on underrepresented founders. Kim Folsom, Co-Founder, reports that as of 
August 2019, Founders First’s portfolio was 80% women and 55% women of color; 70% people of color; 20% military veterans; and 71% located in low/moderate 
income areas. 85% of their companies have under $1m in annual revenues. I can also announce exclusively that according to Kim Folsom, “Founders First 
Capital Partner (F1stcp) has just secured a $100M credit facility commitment from a major institutional impact investor. This positions F1stcp to be the 
largest revenue-based investor platform addressing the funding gap for service-based, small businesses led by underserved and underrepresented founders.”
By contrast, according to PitchBook Data, since the beginning of 2016, companies with women founders have received only 4.4% of venture capital deals. 
Those companies have garnered only about 2% of all capital invested. This is despite the fact that the data says that in fact you’re better off investing 
in women.
Paul Graham observes, “many suspect that venture capital firms are biased against female founders. This would be easy to detect: among their portfolio 
companies, do startups with female founders outperform those without?
A couple months ago, one VC firm (almost certainly unintentionally) published a study showing bias of this type. First Round Capital  found that among its 
portfolio companies, startups with female founders outperformed those without by 63%.” Why are RBI investors investing disproportionately in women & underrepresented founders, and vice versa: why do these founders approach RBI investors? 
I’d argue it’s not that RBI is so unbiased and attractive; it’s that traditional equity VC is biased structurally against some women and underrepresented 
founders.
The Boston Consulting Group and MassChallenge, a US-based global network of accelerators, partnered to study why “women-owned startups are a better bet”. 
Through their analysis and interviews, BCG identified three primary reasons why female founders are less likely to receive VC funds.
The study used multivariate regression analysis to control for education levels and pitch quality to conclude that gender was a statistically significant factor. 
I argue that these 3 reasons are much less applicable for RBI investors than for conventional VCs.
Less need for a belief in breakthrough technology. From the study: “More than men, women founders and their presentations are subject to challenges and 
pushback. For example, more women report being asked during their presentations to establish that they understand basic technical knowledge. And often, 
investors simply presume that the women founders don’t have that knowledge.” However, companies with a focus on early profitability are less likely to 
require an investor to believe in complex, hard-to-predict new technology which is hard to diligence. Instead, the company can pitch itself based on a 
credible financial projection.
Realistic projections. “Male founders are more likely to make bold projections and assumptions in their pitches,” BCG observes, while, “Women, by contrast, 
are generally more conservative in their projections and may simply be asking for less than men.” However, to raise RBI a woman founder does not need to 
promise a valuation of $1 billion within 5 years. Rent the Runway co-founder and CEO Jennifer Hyman said in a recent interview with CNBC’s Julia Boorstin, 
“I haven’t been given the permission or privilege to lose a billion every quarter… I’ve had to bring my company towards profitability…”
Concentration in consumer/branded products startups. BCG reports that, “Many male investors have little familiarity with the products and services that 
women-founded businesses market to other women”—especially in categories such as childcare or beauty. However, RBI investors report that they see a lot of 
proposals for ecommerce and consumer packaged goods geared to mothers. Meghan Cross Breeden, Cofounder of Amplifyher Ventures, observes, “Personal customer 
attachment shouldn’t be a factor in investing; the early investors in Snapchat and Facebook weren’t the Gen Z target demo. Rather, I would imagine that one 
explanation of women garnering rev-share modes of financing is the prevalence of women-led companies in the consumer/branded goods field, which systemically 
is more tangible and revenue driven. Therefore, there’s more revenue to share – as opposed to the typical venture business, which requires capital upfront 
before a J curve of growth.”
Traditional equity VCs are looking for high-risk, high-reward, “swing for the fences” models. The founders of such companies inherently are taking financial 
risk, reputational risk, and career risk.
Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator,  said, “few successful founders grew up desperately poor.” Ricky Yean, a serial founder, agrees: “building and 
sustaining a company that is “designed to grow fast” is especially hard if you grew up desperately poor”.
Most of the founders of the paradigmatic VC home runs were privileged: male, cisgender, well-educated, from affluent families, etc. Think Bill Gates and 
Mark Zuckerberg .
That privilege makes it easier for them to take very high risk. The average person, worried about students loans and long term employability, quite 
rationally is less likely to take the huge risk of founding a company. It’s far safer to just get a job.
Investors who back diverse teams can win much higher returns than the industry norm. Both RBI investors and the founders they back will hopefully 
benefit from this pattern.

From the investors’ point of view, the advantages of the RBI models are manifold. In fact, the Kauffman Foundation  has launched an initiative specifically to support VCs focused on this model. The major advantages to investors are:
Shorter duration, i.e., faster time to liquidity. Typically RBI VCs get their capital back within 3 to 5 years."

"content": "DoorDash  has been on an acquisition tear of late, with Scotty Labs as its latest target. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but this comes after DoorDash acquired Caviar in a deal worth $410 million.
Scotty Labs,  a tele-operations company that is working on technology to enable people to remotely control self-driving cars, raised a $6 million seed round from Gradient Ventures, with participation from Horizon Ventures and Hemi Ventures, last March. The startup had previously worked with Voyage for its self-driving cars in retirement communities.
“Our core belief at Scotty has always been that Autonomy + Remote Assistance is the future,” Scotty CEO Tobenna Arodiogbu wrote on Medium. “We have intentionally always considered ourselves to be the anti-hype company and focused intensely on developing core infrastructure and algorithms to ensure the safe deployment of autonomous vehicles.”
Meanwhile, DoorDash quietly brought on the two co-founders from Lvl5, another company that had built tech to create high-resolution maps for autonomous driving using crowdsourced imagery and computer vision to merge and process the images. In April, Lvl5 announced it was shutting down after the acquisition.
Details of how Scotty Labs and Lvl5 will fit into DoorDash’s business are nonexistent, but you could imagine DoorDash using Scotty’s technologies to remotely control delivery robots or other types of autonomous vehicles.
“We’ll share more updates in the near future but for now, we’re really excited to be part of the amazing DoorDash family and looking forward to building something magical together,” Scotty Labs co-founder Tobenna Arodiogbu wrote on Medium.
From what we understand, the Lvl5 deal was more of an acqui-hire and did not include any of the maps that were built using the company’s technology. Instead, startup Mapillary obtained that trove of hundreds of millions of images.
DoorDash would not comment on what the new hires are working on, but through its robot pilots and partnership with GM, the startup has made no secret of its interest in exploring autonomous technology, specifically looking at how it can improve the cost and efficiency of deliveries, and it would make sense that it would also want to have in-house expertise to own and manage those projects.
DoorDash has experimented with delivery robots before. In 2017, DoorDash partnered with both Starship Technologies and Marble to test food delivery via robot. More recently, DoorDash announced a partnership with GM’s Cruise to test self-driving food delivery cars. DoorDash is also beefing up its in-house team of autonomous and navigation specialists.
This investment in autonomous tech through its acquisition of Scotty Labs and acqui-hire of the team from Lvl5 comes at a time when DoorDash says it is revamping its policies around driver wages.
The enthusiasm and potential of autonomous tech had led to startups creating literally dozens of interesting products that focus on different aspects of this field. But it will take a village to get this tech off the ground, which means that consolidation is inevitable.
DoorDash — operating on the principle of economies of scale — has been pretty aggressive in positioning itself as one of those consolidators. We have heard it tried to merge with Postmates. It bought Caviar this summer. And it has raised an absolute ton of money. In May, DoorDash raised a $400 million round, valuing it at $12.6 billion. Meanwhile, DoorDash’s main competitor, Postmates, is gearing up to go public this quarter. Just this month, the company received the first permit to deploy autonomous delivery bots in San Francisco.
As technology becomes a key way for the crowded arena of delivery startups to differentiate themselves, investing in its own autonomous tech R&D — by way of picking up some of these disparate startups that may have struggled to survive on their own — is one way for DoorDash to build out that tech cred."

"content": "It’s finally Bag Week again! The most wonderful week of the year at TechCrunch. Just in time for back to school, we’re bringing you reviews of bags of all varieties: from backpacks to rollers to messengers to fanny packs.
Honestly, I’d thought I’d have grown out of backpacks by this point in my life. I had a year or two flirtation with messengers, but all roads eventually led back to the over-the-shoulder satchel. As a subway commuter who carries around a laptop at all times, it just works for me.
Until recently, however, I never really had much allegiance to any bag companies. I’ve used JanSport and Crumpler and Herschel and have a closet full of promotional bags I’ve accumulated over the years, but any semblance of brand loyalty has been fleeting at best.
Last year, however, I fell pretty hard for Timbuk2’s Never Check (as hard as a man can fall for a travel backpack). The carry-on backpack joined me for two weeks in Asia, traveling to a handful of different TechCrunch events. It addressed my travel needs better than any bag I’ve used, and 
when I returned to the States, I purchased the company’s Authority Pack for my day to day commute. I like the bag just fine. It’s got a nice assortment of internal pockets, but lacks the kind of versatility I’d gotten used to with the Never Check. Hoping to split the difference, 
I asked the company to send its new Parker Commuter Backpack to take for a spin. So far, so good. The bag does a good job delivering much of the Never Check’s amenities on a scale that works for the nearly two or so hours a day I spend commuting in and out of Manhattan.
Waterproofing was key to the choice, as well. I’d recently lost use of a work MiFi in a freak torrential downpour. It was stowed away in a zipped-up pocked I thought was sufficiently insulated against the elements. Turns out, however, that a little water behind the display 
is a dangerous thing when it comes to a portable Wi-Fi device.
The Parker has that part covered with a wax canvas front, including a couple of external pockets with covered zippers. I was a bit surprised how much of the storage space was monopolized by the trio of out-facing pockets. It’s a 180 from the two slim ones on the Authority.
Here there are zippers on the top and bottom pouches, with the center and largest pocket snapping together with a magnet. It’s an interesting touch and one I’ve not seen much of in backpacks. It does seem to lack the relative security of a zipper, so you might want to skip storing valuables in there, 
but it makes for easy access, which is great for things like keys. I’ve also not had any issue with the three after getting caught in the rain a couple of times. On either side there’s a narrow, but expandable slot for an umbrella and/or water bottle. And like the Never Check, 
the primary zipper expands the bag for additional storage. That’s nice for overnights, or those days when you’re bringing groceries back to the apartment.
Also, like the Never Check, there’s a nearly hidden zipper on the side rear for slipping a 15-inch laptop in and out. Interestingly, that panel can also be accessed through the main compartment. I’m not in love with that part. I do like the way the Never Check keeps the laptop hidden. 
There’s plenty of space inside — more than I generally need day to day. There’s plenty of space for my camera, gym shoes and all of the other crap I lug around, day to day. I could, however, have done with additional pockets inside — spots devoted to things like pens. 
That’s a point for the Authority, which also incorporates a mesh net for loose objects.
The Airmesh back panel is a nice touch, keeping the wearer’s back a bit cooler, especially during this brutal East Coast August. There are plenty of security straps, as well, for cyclists, though those thankfully remove easily for day to day usage.
At $219, the Parker is considerably pricier than the Authority ($129), but it’s got more than enough space and is built to last."

Walmart said the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in New York state court, arose from years of gross negligence and failure to live up to industry standards by Tesla  and the solar panels it designed, installed and promised to operate and maintain safely on the roofs of hundreds of Walmart stores.
Bloomberg was the first to report on the court filing. The lawsuit is aimed at Tesla Energy Operations, a division within the clean energy and electric vehicle automaker that was formerly known as SolarCity .
Tesla did not return a request for comment. A Walmart spokesperson said there was nothing else to add beyond the lawsuit filed Tuesday. TechCrunch will update the article if Tesla responds.
The lawsuit comes just days after Tesla CEO Elon Musk  announced a new rental offering for solar power in a bid to reboot the flagging renewable energy business. Tesla’s share of the solar market has declined since its merger with SolarCity in 2016. 
In the second quarter Tesla deployed only 29 megawatts of new solar installations, while the number one and two providers of consumer solar, SunRun and Vivint Solar, installed 103 megawatts and 56 megawatts, respectively.
Walmart has asked Tesla to remove solar panels from all 240 locations where they have been installed as well as pay for damages related to fires that the retailer alleges stem from the panels. The lawsuit points to several fires on the retailer’s rooftops that allegedly stem from Tesla solar panels.
The lawsuit states:
To state the obvious, properly designed, installed, inspected, and maintained solar systems do not spontaneously combust, and the occurrence of multiple fires involving Tesla’s solar systems is but one 
unmistakable sign of negligence by Tesla. To this day, Tesla has not provided Walmart with the complete set of final “root cause” analyses needed to identify the precise defects in its systems that caused all of the fires described above. 
The number of defects, however, is overwhelming and plainly indicative of systemic, widespread failures by Tesla to meet the standard of care, as set forth in the governing contracts, as to the solar systems installed at Walmart’s stores.
Unsatisfied with Tesla’s actions, Walmart requested in May 2018 that the company disconnect all of the solar panel systems, according to the lawsuit. Tesla complied. However, Walmart alleges that another fire erupted even after the systems were disconnected.
In Walmart’s view, numerous problems with the design and installation were propelled by SolarCity’s business model, which relied on “installing as many solar panels as quickly as possible.”
SolarCity’s business model was ultimately a bust. Unbeknownst to its customers until public reports later exposed its shoddy practices, SolarCity suffered from “a quality assurance problem,” the lawsuit alleges.
Tesla announced plans to merge with SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial all-stock $2.6 billion deal that closed in November of that year."

"content": "The process of using the Stoic journaling app is simple: You open the app in the morning and the evening, when you’ll be prompted to answer a couple of questions and perform a few simple exercises.
For example, this evening the app asked me to rate my current level of fulfillment and to identify what made me smile today, while also pointing me to guided exercises like journaling and breathing.
Stoic is part of the current batch of startups at Y Combinator  (it’s taking the stage today at Demo Day). Founder Maciej Lobodzinski told me that his goal is to help users understand the different factors influencing their mental and emotional state.
“The core of the app is: We have this insight and we see what influences your mood and what you feel,” Lobodzinski said. He suggested that this is very different from the “super transactional” idea embedded in my other mental health and wellness apps, 
where “you pay for my app and you feel better.” In his view, “You should feel how you feel. It’s okay, how you feel, but you should know why you are feeling this way.”
So once there are a couple of weeks of data in the app, you should be able to look back and see how you were feeling on a certain day, and if there were activities that made you feel more or less fulfilled. Over time, Lobodzinski hopes to add more 
insights about “what influenced you, why you feel this way, why you are productive.” As the name implies, Stoic is inspired by Lobodzinski’s interest in classical Stoic philosophy (he’s not the first to suggest that the approach has direct 
applications in the tech industry), and the app even includes quotes from Stoic philosophers.
“It’s an extremely practical framework,” he said. “When I talk to users, there are entrepreneurs, investors, traders — people who found out about the app because they were looking for how to deal with their stress …
If you are stressed with your everyday life and you can get the advice of the emperor of Rome, who dealt with much more serious things, it’s amazing how much better you can feel after that.”
At the same time, users have the option to receive quotes from different schools of thought — not just Stoicism but also Buddhism, Taoism and Catholicism. For some users, their app experience won’t be explicitly 
focused on Stoicism, but Lobodzinski said that even then, it forms the “spine” of the app’s approach.
The basic app is free, but Stoic charges $27.99 per year for a premium version that includes iCloud syncing and additional content."

"content": "The path to general AI — and possibly superintelligence — is being paved before our eyes. And with the proliferation of an AI-driven society, 
the social and economic value of such technology is also on the rise. In turn, harnessing and leveraging such technology needs to extend beyond the interests of venture capitalists, 
investment groups and entrepreneurs — and also be a priority on a geopolitical scale.
When the global economy starts to feel the shift ushered in with mass-adoption of AI, the United States needs to be leading the charge as opposed to chasing the pack.
If the U.S. is to compete on a global level, they’ll face an arms race of sorts from a litany of nations that are already doubling-down on the massive advantages 
that come with national AI proficiency. In fact, 18 different countries have launched national AI strategies, with government funding ranging from $20 million to almost $2 billion.
A first step in the right direction was taken by the Trump administration recently when the president signed an executive order launching the American AI Initiative. 
This policy will funnel federal funding and resources toward AI-specific research while also implementing U.S.-led international AI standards. Additionally, the program will call for new research 
into increasing AI literacy in American workers.
Unfortunately, there are no specifics around what exactly this new program actually looks like in practice, and there is no additional research being dedicated toward AI development. 
There are no timelines for implementation of these initiatives, only a vague goal of roughly six-ish months before a detailed plan is rolled out. Jason Furman, a Harvard professor 
who helped draft the Obama administration’s report on AI, said that the plan had “all the right elements” but was also “aspirational with no details and is not self-executing.” Yet, 
the importance of government involvement in AI R&D cannot be overstated. If we remain on the path we’re on, one where large technology companies and VC firms are funding the bulk of 
AI research, the country would only see pockets of growth around the largest technology companies and the regions of the country would continue to stagnate. We would not be able to 
work on major moonshot projects and collectively pool our resources for the greater good across all regions of the U.S. All innovations would be tightly controlled by technology 
companies and adoption rates would not move up and actually make a difference in the way we utilize AI. This would result in a marginal talent pool, and new developments would be 
those of technology innovators — not problem-solvers. Everything would be driven by its contribution to business and not its contribution to society at-large.
So, government involvement matters, yet the administration can’t be solely responsible for catalyzing the change needed by the American workforce — it falls on us as well. So that begs the question…
How can the private sector build on what the federal government has put in place?
The program focuses on five key pillars: Research and development, infrastructure, governance, workforce and international engagement. Like Furman said, those concepts are well and good, but they 
remain vague and still clearly undefined. But, even if the administration’s program isn’t hitting the ground running, that doesn’t mean that you and I can’t push the ball in the right direction. 
So, how can we as a workforce help execute on the program? What do we need to do to enact the ideals that the federal government is focused on in AI?
Focus on building AI-literacy in American workers
Until the American workforce itself is concerned with being AI-first, we will see challenges in implementation, adoption and deployment, and AI literacy will be largely confined to the areas 
in which it’s already being heavily used (automation, customer service, insights, engagement, etc.).
Additionally, these industries aren’t even using AI to actually solve problems or improve society, they are largely using it as an autopilot. And if AI is being used simply to automate processes for tech companies, 
then we’re missing out on the opportunity to use it to its full advantage to solve actual sociological issues around hunger, poverty and healthcare.
And the focus needs to extend beyond the workforce and into the classroom. All STEM programs in American schools need AI-based coursework. Universities need AI-based programs and intelligence labs, 
such as MIT, for example, where roughly 25% of faculty conduct research on intelligence in labs like the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, the Robust Robotics Group and the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).
Our academic institutions and research centers would continue to strive as centers of excellence around the world, meaning that the best and brightest minds would continue to be attracted and would keep our talent pool stocked. 
Our universities would increase enrollment for AI/digital experts, as those roles would be the golden mature standard.
Startups need to swarm and work closely with federal AI strategy
While I hate to use cliches, this is a “teamwork makes the dream work” situation. Aligning the startup community with government strategy would allow innovation and social good to walk hand-in-hand when it comes to AI development. 
This would lead in new space technologies, create new innovation for society in food, energy and health, and create a lifestyle that balances efficiency and leisure. It also would allow American corporations to go after dispersion 
and breakthrough innovation. From a government perspective, this means continuing to provide open and structured data sets for the public to use while still protecting the sensitive information that keeps our citizens safe. 
Providing these data sets is the first step, but making others aware through education campaigns is also important
Make AI all-inclusive
Much the same way that IT experts, coders and web/app developers had to learn to work side-by-side with business owners, marketers and production-level employees across the business ecosystem over the last two-and-a-half decades, 
we must bridge the “gap” between AI experts, technologists and leading technology companies and solutions owners, general SMBs and corporate America to develop an inclusive and universally understandable AI strategy.
The advancement of machine learning models, specifically deep learning, relies on the ingestion of data — structured or unstructured. The sharing of this data, from people involved in day-to-day problems and solutions to 
technologists who are concerned with the big picture, is the key to developing innovative and inclusive AI solutions. A better AI future built on diverse data sets requires both parties to work collaboratively.
Data is officially the most valuable commodity on earth and the countries that win the race to harness and use it to its maximum value and efficiency are going to position themselves favorably around the globe. 
And if America is to win the race, it will take the buy-in of the collective public, private and government entities in our country. If we are to move past improving our viewing patterns on Netflix and start 
solving the brass-tax issues in our country’s society, it will come as a result of the convergence of government, society and business."

"content": "If you’re like me, and I’m just going to assume most of you are, motion sickness is a serious consideration on any car trip where you’re not driving. 
So what are we supposed to do in self-driving vehicles? Researchers are finally looking into this question with an experiment designed to see just what makes 
people like us so sick.
The study, at the University of Michigan, was undertaken because the researchers realized that if millions of people can’t read or do work in autonomous 
vehicles, that massively reduces the draw of using them in the first place. And it turns out there has been almost no investigation of why certain people 
get motion sickness in this context, what makes it better or worse, and so on.
“Very few studies have been conducted in cars; instead, a lot of the work has been done for sea and air transportation modes, performed in driving simulators 
or on motion platforms,” explained lead investigator for the project, Monica Jones, in a university news release. “A lot of scales that exist in the 
literature are based on nausea. If we design to a vomiting response, we have really missed the mark on autonomous vehicles.”
Basically the cars should be designed around making people actually comfortable, not stopping just short of losing their lunch. What does that even consist 
of? That’s what these initial experiments are meant to explore.
The team collected 52 people from a variety of demographics and had them sit in the car while it navigated the university’s Mcity  Test Facility, a sort 
of mock urban environment meant for exactly this kind of work. The drive involved the usual turns, stops and accelerations you would experience being 
driven around a city, and participants were asked to perform some basic tasks on an iPad and answer questions posed by a researcher in the car. I can tell 
you I’m feeling queasy just thinking about taking part. They were observed for indications of discomfort and were told to report any such feelings — and of 
course let the researchers know if they needed to stop. Sensors watched for changes in temperature or perspiration, among other things.
The early findings (PDF) are not exactly surprising, but they’re a start. It may not be front page news that people using a gadget while in a self-driving 
car tended to feel more sick. But no one has ever actually studied this, so if we’re going to treat it seriously one way or the other, it needs to be 
directly observed. And indeed there were other factors that cropped up as well. Younger people reported higher motion sickness levels, for instance. 
Why? When?
“Passenger responses are complicated and have many dimensions,” said Jones. And to measure those responses the team built up a database of thousands of 
measurements and observations that extend beyond a simple “misery scale,” but include context and other types of pain or discomfort.
This is just the beginning of what is sure to be a longer-term study of how to make self-driving vehicles as inclusive — and popular — as possible. 
Certainly if they get to the bottom of it, I (and all of you out there like me) will be much more likely to use an AV for my daily commute."

"content": "Movie ticket subscription service MoviePass  has exposed tens of thousands of customer card numbers and personal credit cards because a critical 
server was not protected with a password.
Mossab Hussein, a security researcher at Dubai-based cybersecurity firm SpiderSilk, found an exposed database on one of the company’s many subdomains. 
The database was massive, containing 161 million records at the time of writing and growing in real time. Many of the records were normal computer-generated 
logging messages used to ensure the running of the service — but many also included sensitive user information, such as MoviePass customer card numbers.
These MoviePass customer cards are like normal debit cards: they’re issued by Mastercard and store a cash balance, which users who sign up to the subscription 
service can use to pay to watch a catalog of movies. For a monthly subscription fee, MoviePass uses the debit card to load the full cost of the movie, which 
the customer then uses to pay for the movie at the cinema.
We reviewed a sample of 1,000 records and removed the duplicates. A little over half contained unique MoviePass debit card numbers. Each customer card record 
had the MoviePass debit card number and its expiry date, the card’s balance and when it was activated.
The database had more than 58,000 records containing card data — and was growing by the minute.
We also found records containing customers’ personal credit card numbers and their expiry date — which included billing information, including names and 
postal addresses. Among the records we reviewed, we found records with enough information to make fraudulent card purchases.
Some records, however, contained card numbers that had been masked except for the last four digits.
The database also contained email address and some password data related to failed login attempts. We found hundreds of records containing users’ email 
addresses and presumably incorrectly typed passwords — which was logged — in the database. We verified this by attempting to log into the app with an email 
address and password that didn’t exist but only we knew. Our dummy email address and password appeared in the database almost immediately.
None of the records in the database were encrypted.
Hussain contacted MoviePass chief executive Mitch Lowe  by email — which TechCrunch has seen — over the weekend but did not hear back. It was only after 
TechCrunch reached out Tuesday when MoviePass took the database offline.
It’s understood that the database may have been exposed for months, according to data collected by cyberthreat intelligence firm RiskIQ, which first detected 
the system in late June.
We asked MoviePass several questions — including why the initial email disclosing the security lapse was ignored, for how long the server was exposed and its 
plans to disclose the incident to customers and state regulators. When reached, a spokesperson did not comment by our deadline.
MoviePass has been on a roller coaster since it hit mainstream audiences last year. The company quickly grew its customer base from 1.5 million to 2 million 
customers in less than a month. But MoviePass took a tumble after critics said it grew too fast, forcing the company to cease operating briefly after the 
company ran out of money. The company later said it was profitable, but then suspended service, supposedly to work on its mobile app. It now says it has 
“restored [service] to a substantial number of our current subscribers.”
Leaked internal data from April said its customer numbers went from three million subscribers to about 225,000. And just this month MoviePass reportedly 
changed user passwords to hobble access for customers who use the service extensively.
Hussein said the company was negligent in leaving data unencrypted in an exposed, accessible database.
“We keep on seeing companies of all sizes using dangerous methods to maintain and process private user data,” Hussein told TechCrunch. “In the case of 
MoviePass, we are questioning the reason why would internal technical teams ever be allowed to see such critical data in plaintext — let alone the fact that 
the data set was exposed for public access by anyone,” he said.
The security researcher said he found the exposed database using his company-built web mapping tools, which peeks into non-password protected databases 
that are connected to the internet, and identifies the owner. The information is privately disclosed to companies, often in exchange for a bug bounty.
Hussein has a history of finding exposed databases. In recent months he found one of Samsung’s development labs exposed on the internet. He also found an 
exposed backend database belonging to Blind, an anonymity-driven workplace social network, exposing private user data."

"content": "It’s finally Bag Week again! The most wonderful week of the year at TechCrunch. Just in time for back to school, we’re bringing you reviews of bags of all varieties: from backpacks to rollers to messengers to fanny packs.
This year, like last year, I decided to focus on a specific niche in the bag community: waxed canvas. Last year I reviewed a handful of bags from Ona, Filson and other purveyors of fine waxed goods. But there are many more to choose from, so I’ve collected a second handful and used them all for long enough to get a sense of their strengths and weaknesses.
Waxed canvas is a wonderful material. The natural fibers infused with wax provide water resistance, structure, protection and a great look that only gets better with time as you use it. It’s my favorite material and it should be yours too. Only trouble is, it can be expensive. But keep in mind that these bags are the kind that you take with you for a decade or two.
For this post I focused on laptop bags, but later in the festivities I’ll have a couple more waxed bags more in the “messenger” style, so keep your eyes peeled. Pros:
Solid medium-weight material and construction
Good padding and leather protective layer
Surprising amount of space and pockets
Cons:
Somehow lacks panache
Leather thongs instead of metal zipper pulls not for everyone
Store link
Of all the bags I’ve looked at for this roundup, this one is perhaps the most straightforward, in that it isn’t convertible, super-heavy, super-light, blue or anything like that. It’s just a solid all-purpose laptop bag made of waxed canvas and leather, and as such makes for a sort of baseline with which to compare everything else. The Bolt’s canvas isn’t as thick as that on other Waterfield bags, since it’s lined and padded on the inside. It still has a nice finish, though, and the leather base and trim are similarly high quality. The strap is, like the other bags from the company, nylon, where I would prefer canvas, but the grippy leather shoulder pad included is among the most practical and comfortable I’ve used.
Where the Bolt excels is not in sheer space, since it’s rather a compact bag (you can choose a larger size if you prefer), but in feeling that space is used well. There are snap pockets in the front and a larger zip one as well for quick access, all protected by a small flap but still easy to get at. On the back is a flap pocket and luggage strap so it can sit safely atop your roller bag.
And opening up the main compartment through its weather-proof zipper, the bag accordions open pleasantly to reveal laptop, tablet, notebook and other slots all easily accessible. I even like the color in there!
I only wish it inspired a little more love. It’s not a bad-looking bag by any means, but it feels very pedestrian — few stylistic choices seem to have been made. It’s practical but not individual. To some that won’t matter — this is a solid bag. But it lacks a certain je ne sais quois that the company has to spare in its other bags. Pros:
Great material and construction
Compact but not microscopic
Cons:
Awkward to carry without strap
Not a lot of room in there (by design, but still)
Store link
Sometimes you’re just going out with a tablet or laptop and book, and don’t feel like taking a whole messenger-style bag or briefcase. This little guy is sort of halfway between a laptop sleeve and a bag, and if you don’t mind its purselike nature, it’s a perfect companion for those more minimal trips.
The laptop compartment is snug and well-padded. The outside has a slip pocket with some nooks for pens and the like, big enough to fit an 8.5×11″ notebook or not-too-thick book. Just don’t try putting groceries or anything in there. Closure is a magnetic snap that feels secure enough, but I’d just as soon have something a little more physical. I’d like to mention that the closure strap looks a little sloppy in the photos above, but it’s really not like that in general use and will wear in nicely. And although it feels great to carry this light little guy with the shoulder strap (which stows away decently well), carrying it like a sleeve or clutch isn’t so hot — a small handle or strap would make this much better.
I’d recommend this to anyone who has a larger bag for trips but doesn’t want to pack and unpack it every time they want to step out to the coffee shop. This would work well as a sub-bag or laptop sleeve if you have lots of room in the big one. Pros:
Excellent lighter material that will age well
Straightforward style and solid straps
Great giant brass zippers
Cons:
Which side’s the front?
Unstructured interior can make stowage and retrieval annoying
Store link
Coming from a shop more known for totes and lightweight, fashionable gear for everyday urban living, this one is heavy duty for them but light compared with some others in this roundup. Its style is subtle and straightforward, but high quality.
The material is a lighter weight and color canvas with a crispy feel that will very quickly show patterns of use as, for example, one front pocket is habitually used for a book or keys. Empty it is possibly the lightest waxed bag I’ve used, which of course makes it good for anyone trying to stay minimal. The simple leather straps are sturdy and comfortable, though their springy, upright nature does mean they occasionally interfere with access. I love the huge brass zipper and pulls, though I could do without the leather bits (you can remove them). I didn’t like the plain natural canvas strap at first, but it, like other aspects of the bag, has grown on me.
The simplicity of the design is good, but it also leads to some problems. Unless you look closely it can be hard to tell which side is the front — only the zipper flap and small label hint at it. Something to secure or differentiate the front or rear pockets, even as simple as removing the divider in the back, would be welcome.
Inside has three divisions, but the billowing, unstructured canvas plus the limited zip-top entrance can make stowage and retrieval a little awkward, more so than a flap-top bag, anyway. A tighter compartment for a laptop or tablet would be great in here rather than having it swim in a big undifferentiated section. There’s also no padding, so I’d recommend keeping your device in its own case (this also helps it fill out the space). Pros:
Classy messenger/briefcase crossover style
Lovely blue color
Great handle, closure and straps
Cons:
Not particularly waxy or robust
Steel and brass? Sacrilege
Interior material not for everyone (also has a tacky watermark)
Store link
Waxed canvas is normally tan or brown, but that’s just tradition. I like the forest green of the Croots bag from last year or the Saddleback one below, but the rich navy blue of this Manhattan Portage Token bag is also excellent. The material is very light, with a fine weave and barely any wax. That means it probably won’t show the characteristic scuffs and patterns that give this type of bag its personality. (You can always wax it yourself.)
This bag, with its half-flap and top handle, straddles the line between laptop bag and briefcase. It’s not particularly thick but has lots of room for big documents, laptops and other long items. Its structure means it’ll stay relatively svelte even when full — this won’t get lumpy. The leather straps and trim are a nice chocolate color and complement the blue well. It’s not heavy or stiff, and the shoulder strap in particular is very pliable — though so long I had to knot it to keep the extra out of the way (fortunately it looks cool that way). The snap closure can be a little tricky to get right by feel, but attaches solidly. The handle, which folds flat but pops up when you need it, is genius — probably the best handle of all the bags in this roundup, though not quite as robust as the Saddleback (but what is?).
The interior isn’t to my liking. The red nylon watermarked with a branded pattern seems sort of gauche compared to the refined outside, and at the same time it feels like this choice of material should have allowed for more small pockets. It should help keep things dry, though, which is good considering the thinness of the waxed canvas layer.
Pros:
Convertible style makes it a good companion for conventions, business trips, etc.
Plenty of handles and exterior pockets
Cons:
Not the best of both worlds (but not the worst either)
Straps make it feel bulky and lumpy if not stowed carefully
When I’m at CES or some other big show where I do a lot of walking but need to carry my basic loadout everywhere, I often wish I could transform my laptop bag into a backpack or vice versa. The Saratoga accomplishes this, and while it ends up compromising both forms as a result, it also fundamentally scratches an important itch.
The material is a soft-feeling canvas that doesn’t feel very rugged but is showing a nice wear pattern already. The weather-sealed zippers are good news for anyone who wants to take this out in the rain, but there are just too many of them. Six on the exterior, five visible on the front side! This thing jingles like a festive little elf. The back of the bag is a large pocket in which the pack straps sit, providing extra padding while they’re in there. You pull them out and clip them onto some unobtrusive little D-rings, and boom, it’s a backpack. Doing the reverse is a little harder, as you need to make sure the straps don’t bunch up in their pouch.
I would have much preferred a more elegant pocket solution, not least because some of the pockets don’t make much sense while in one or the other configuration. And the leather bottom, while great in briefcase mode, makes it seem a little lopsided in backpack mode. Obviously these are drawbacks inherent to the switchable design, which brings its own benefits, but they’re worth considering. I might have liked a single big pocket on the front that can be opened from the side or top, and sub-pockets within.
The interior, while it’s the same watermarked red nylon as the one above, is populated with tons of little pockets and useful stashes that helpfully all close independently, meaning there’s no need to re-pack when you’re going from one mode to the other.
(I can’t seem to find this for sale any more — but keep your eyes open if you like it.) Pros:
Pockets! So many pockets!!
Cons:
Maybe too many pockets
Store link
I’ll just say right off the bat that this one isn’t for me — I prefer a plainer exterior, and this thing does not have that. On the other hand, for the organized gadget fiend, this might be a fantastic match. The front side is just pocket after pocket. There are two big enough for a small phone, another good for a notebook, pens or a power adapter, and a third with a removable divider that could hold all manner of things small and large. Nothing too bulky will fit in them, but any number of audio recorders, lens filters, earbuds and so on will go in there.
Then there are two totally separate full-size compartments, one with more organizing space inside and both with plenty of padding. The simple strap is easy to release and stashes inside nicely.
Built like a waxed tank
Seriously, this thing is a beast
Spacious and handsome
Cons:
Also heavy as a tank
Very basic pockets and interior
Price reflects its “for life” nature

This bag came with a label on it sporting the company’s motto: “They’ll fight over it when you’re dead.” And I’m inclined to believe it. This is definitely by far the heaviest-duty waxed canvas bag I’ve had the pleasure of reviewing, which may or may not make it to your taste.
The olive-colored canvas is very thick and stiff, and waxed all the way through, not just in a layer on the outside. The stitching is industrial-grade and probably uses half a mile of thread. Quarter-inch-thick leather plates stiff as a board protect the back and bottom of the bag, and another serves to connect with the handle. The strap is a kind of folded-over canvas that feels even tougher than the leather. On top is a unique and practical thick leather handle that folds flat if necessary but feels very robust. The muscular materials and construction, however, preclude the inclusion of fine details like small pockets and pen sheaths. Instead there are two major exterior pockets that simply fold over themselves to close up, being held shut by the flap; there’s also room between them and the main compartment. Smaller side pockets under the massy strap hardware are good spots for flashlights but pens may disappear to the bottom.
This thing is also heavy as hell. Empty, it weighs as much as another bag with a light load. For some that weight will be reassuring, but for others it’s just too much.
Inside the main compartment is plenty of room but little organization; there’s a single flap that will hold a laptop in place (my 13-inch MacBook Pro fits perfectly), and beyond that it’s just a big empty space. This is the only briefcase-style bag that rivals Filson’s (in my last roundup) for overnight capability. This one is definitely going to get your stuff waxy for the first few trips, though.
That’s all for today, but keep an eye out for more waxed canvas bags later in Bag Week as well!"

"content": "Joichi Ito, the embattled director of the M.I.T. Media Lab, has stepped down according to a statement by MIT’s president, L. Rafael Reif. The news was first reported by The New York Times, which had received a copy of an email sent by Ito to university provost Martin A. Schmidt.
“After giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks,” the now-former director writes, “I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately.”
In addition to resigning as director, Reif’s statement also confirmed that Ito resigned as a professor of the university.
The ‘matter’ to which the letter refers to is Ito’s reported connections to Jeffrey Epstein. The financier died in prison by hanging on August 10, following an arrest a month prior on federal charges of sex tracking minors.
Ito was among several high profile and powerful people whose alleged ties to the disgraced billionaire came into sharp focus following his arrest. In the immediate aftermath of that arrest, it came to light that the MIT Media Lab and Ito personally received funds from Epstein, to which Ito apologized in an August 15th letter.
The allegations against Ito intensified overnight following a report by Ronan Farrow in The New Yorker that Ito’s engagement of Epstein were far deeper than had been previously been acknowledged. According to emails and documents discovered by Farrow, Ito and MIT Media Lab’s head of development, Peter Cohen, worked in tandem to conceal Epstein’s contributions from MIT’s central fundraising office, such as by marking donations anonymous and keeping his name out of disclosure statements.
Ito has long stood firm that the facts of his relationship with Epstein have been misreported. In an email to the Times, Ito said that the New Yorker piece was “full of factual errors.”
In response to Farrow’s piece, M.I.T, president L. Rafael Reif in today’s statement said:
Because the accusations in the story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation. This morning, I asked MIT’s General Counsel to engage a prominent law firm to design and conduct this process. I expect the firm to conduct this review as swiftly as possible, and to report back to me and to the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation, MIT’s governing board.
The MIT Media Lab  is a storied research center with a long legacy of contributions to science, technology, and innovation. There are no indications yet on who might replace Ito.
In addition to the MIT Media Lab, Ito sits as a board director for The New York Times Company, where he sits on the company’s audit committee.
One can’t help but point out a perennial tweet that Ito wrote more than a decade ago about fundraising: reminder to self: don't invest with or take money from assholes."

"content": "Is capital moral or amoral?
In the predominant view held in Silicon Valley today, capital is amoral — cash is cash, and regardless of where it comes from, once it leaves the hand of its investor or donor, it no longer has that individual’s taint. That money might have previously been spent on acquiring access to underage girls, or murder, or espionage, but now it is being spent on something productive, something useful. Isn’t that ultimately a net win for society?
That culture of fundraising is under an exacting microscope this week after the MIT Technology Review reported that Nicholas Negroponte, the founder of the famed MIT Media Lab, would have continued to take convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s donations to the research center.
[… He] said he had recommended that [Joichi Ito, the lab’s current director] take Epstein’s money. “If you wind back the clock,” he added, “I would still say, ‘Take it.’” And he repeated, more emphatically, “‘Take it.’”
The comments, made during a meeting of the lab’s staff, shocked many of the participants, with some angrily replying in the heat of the moment. As the Review noted, “Kate Darling, a research scientist at the MIT Media Lab, shouted, ‘Nicholas, shut up!’ Negroponte responded that he would not shut up and that he had founded the Lab, to which Darling said, ‘We’ve been cleaning up your messes for the past eight years.’”
Epstein funded projects widely in the tech world through the Edge Foundation and other initiatives, and his acquaintances read like a who’s-who of tech luminaries.
Yet, this week’s controversy over fundraising is hardly novel. Just last year, SoftBank’s Vision Fund was dealing with the fallout in its own fundraising after Saudi Arabia — the fund’s largest limited partner with a $45 billion commitment to the $93 billion fund — murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in its consulate in Istanbul.
These two singular cases also connect to the larger story about the U.S. government’s active shutdown of Chinese venture capital dollars flowing into the Valley for fear of foreign intelligence espionage. Through the modernization of legal tools like CFIUS, to the Pentagon’s creation of a Trusted Capital Marketplace, to reversals of acquisitions like the unwinding of Chinese company Kunlun’s purchase of gay dating app Grindr, the government has repeatedly been telling entrepreneurs: it matters where your capital comes from.
Indeed, that’s the very quandary that Silicon Valley is facing these days. Its amoral view of capital is increasingly clashing with the reality that it matters a whole heck of a lot where that capital comes from. And it is about time that founders and investors take responsibility for cleaning up a capital base that has become more and more squalid over time.
Why can’t capital just be immoral? Well, Epstein’s web of donations provided him with a philanthropic sheen that eased access to the highest echelons of society while he committed his crimes. Saudi Arabia is the largest investor in Silicon Valley not only because it drives a return and diversifies its oil-dependent economy, but also because it can Valley-wash the horrific rights abuses and atrocities it commits against all of its citizens, including women, LGBT people, and immigrants.
(But hey, women can drive now, just in time for autonomous vehicles.)
This amoral versus moral view of capital is just the classic debate in philosophy between utilitarianism versus deontological duties, but Silicon Valley has almost exclusively chosen the former rather than the latter. My bank asks me more questions about my $50 deposits than many founders ask about where that $500 million check comes from.
That’s perhaps understandable in context. Founders — as with non-profit leaders — fundraise around-the-clock. When a check finally arrives, they don’t bother to ask a bunch of due diligence questions. They just want that money to hit the bank and get back to building what they were intending to the entire time.
It’s a mode of operating that continues to the present day. I was chatting with a founder this week, and during demo day last week, he got an emailed check for $50,000 from an investor in the audience. It was amazing, he said with exclamation points to me, and it sounded like he just added the check to the pile he had accumulated. Who is this person? Do we know where his capital comes from? Is there going to be some scandal that shocks the startup in a couple of years? Yet the excitement was palpable — the round was closed, and it was the easiest $50,000 ever fundraised.
Those diligence questions probably didn’t need to be asked a decade or two in the Valley, back when a few dozen firms mostly raised from blue-chip university and non-profit endowments as well as state pension funds.
Today though, there are all kinds of sources of capital, with little clarity about where the capital is coming from. Take, for instance, Carlos Ghosn, who once headed Nissan Motors and is currently on trial in Japan for a variety of financial crimes. He has been accused of embezzling millions of dollars for a VC fund run by his son by running a kickback scheme through a Nissan distributor in Lebanon. As the Wall Street Journal reported a little more than a week ago:
In March 2015, the Ghosns set up in Delaware an investment vehicle called Shogun Investments, which Mr. Ghosn described as a fund that would invest in Silicon Valley startups. Mr. Ghosn was majority owner while his son, Anthony, held a stake, according to people familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Ghosn, who was about to graduate from Stanford University, was working at the time as chief of staff for Silicon Valley venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale, providing the elder Mr. Ghosn a close-up view of the tech investment world. The lofty returns had stunned him, according to one of the people.
That fund would go on to fund some of the most well-known unicorns in the world:
“Following our phone conversation, I ordered a transfer of $3 million,” Carlos Ghosn wrote in a December 2017 email to his son, who was 22 years old at the time.
Of that amount, $2 million was for an investment in Grab, a Southeast Asian competitor to Uber Technologies Inc., Mr. Ghosn wrote, adding that he was sending “$1 million for the company of your friend that you think will do very well.” It wasn’t clear which company Mr. Ghosn was referring to.
I would love a world in which founders asked all the right due diligence questions. I would love for them to inquire about limited partners, about how wealth was created, and how it has been invested. But I am also aware that in what can be a desperate search for funds, those questions may well never get asked in the first place.
If you want to stop the capital laundering taking place every day in the Valley, you have to create active, real-time antidotes. That means stopping it at every point of contact, every single opportunity where it can infect the ecosystem.
And so, we need better systems as a community and as an ecosystem to cleanse ourselves of this dirty money. We need “know-your-capital” processes that are standardized, robust, and accurate so that every check can be verified before it hits the bank. We need tools to verify that a startup or non-profit has actually followed those KYC processes, so that employees don’t suddenly show up at work and realize they are making money for a bunch of murderers. It’s “trust but verify.”
Systematization and process are key to execution, but that doesn’t disclaim the responsibility for the Valley’s leaders to take a moral stance here. Utilitarianism only takes you so far — it does matter that you take capital from a bad actor. Negroponte is wrong to say that he would still take Epstein’s money, regardless of what that capital might have funded at the MIT Media Lab.
Taking responsibility for your capital is part of being a leader of an organization today. Hopefully, the next generation of founders will take a look at Epstein, and Khashoggi, and China, and Ghosn, and the Sacklers, and a whole host of other case studies and learn from them and change their fundraising practices. A moral view on capital isn’t a cost of doing business — it’s simply the right thing to do."

"content": "“Carnival Row” offers an unlikely mix of genres, laying out a murder mystery in a world of fairies and other mythical creatures, while also delivering a healthy dose of allegorical politics.
And as we explain in the latest episode of the Original Content podcast, the show (recently released on Amazon Prime Video) does take some getting used to. There’s a certain clumsiness in the way the opening episode insists on its grittiness and adult themes — and most viewers will probably need some time before they stop gawking at the fairy sex and focus instead on the story and characters.
Once they do, though, “Carnival Row” offers plenty of rewards. Orlando Bloom and Cara Delevingne star as Philo and Vignette — a police investigator and a “fae” refugee, respectively, who have a complicated romantic past together. Bloom and Delevingne may not be entirely up to the task of creating complex and memorable characters, but the world that creators Travis Beacham and René Echavarria have built around them is rich, detailed and strange.
The pair is also surrounded by a strong supporting cast that includes Jared Harris (“The Crown”) and Indira Varma (“Game of Thrones”) — and ultimately, the fantasy, the politics and the mystery do come together in satisfying ways.
In addition to reviewing “Carnival Row,” we also discuss YouTube’s settlement with the FTC and listener response to last week’s review of “The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.”

TechCrunch had our debut confab for enterprise types this week at Yerba Buena Center in SF, where we heard from Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, Apple VP Susan Prescott of Apple, and Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich. We were sold out, which perhaps isn’t all that surprising given the amount of interest in enterprise these days. Expect more events to come.
Our Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos hosted a panel with leading enterprise VCs, and she selected the most interesting points from that conversation and from her calls with them for Extra Crunch members. Hear a bit from Jason Green of Emergence Capital, Rebecca Lynn of Canvas Ventures and Maha Ibrahim of Canaan Partners and what they are investing in these days.
And if you want to hear even more from Jason Green  and yours truly, head over to TechCrunch’s VC podcast Equity, where we shot live from Yerba Buena along with host Kate Clark with a special focus on enterprise startups.
Maha Ibrahim: I feel like people are focusing too much on metrics and not as much on [the total addressable market]. We make money [when a startup strikes on a] huge, huge market.
But there’s [also] so much correlation between consumer and enterprise startups in that we want customers that love the product. We want customers that come back and come back and come back to us, without us having to pay for them to come back. So the equivalent in a consumer company would be me having to spend advertising dollars to acquire that customer again, as opposed to that customer just coming back because he or she loves what I’m doing. The same goes for the enterprise."

"content": "Back in June Uber went on a hiring spree in New York, hiring at least 100 fintech-oriented tech workers to ostensibly look at creating products to increase loyalty and engagement among users and drivers, including things like banking. Cue a flurry of speculation. It now looks like Uber  is taking baby-steps towards building such a raft of products out, potentially by offering loans directly to drivers, according to a report from Recode/Vox.
The story is based on the emergence of an in-app survey which was sent to some drivers talking about a “new financial product” aimed at drivers “in a time of need.” The survey then went on to question drivers’ use of financing loans of $1,000 or less in the last three years. It asked “what amount are you most likely to request?” It then gave them options top pick from “Less than $100,” “Between $100 and $250,” “Between $250 and $500” and “More than $500.”
At this time there’s no indication of timing on a small loans product offering to drivers, and Uber has not publicly commented on the emergence of the survey’s existence.
However, Uber already has form in this space. It has offered cash advance programs to drivers in California and Michigan, although the company was criticised for what some called “pay-day loans”. It’s also offered leases on new cars to drivers in the past and currently offers a co-branded credit card with Visa and an Uber Cash digital wallet for riders.
Uber would not be alone in rolling out small cash loans to its workers, given given that large companies such as Walmart  and others already offer lucrative payroll advances and loans to employees.
But the fact that it now has a very large FinTech team suggests this won’t the end of us hearing about Uber’s tentative moves into this space."

The big story
In one fell swoop, Stripe may disrupt the entire financial services ecosystem.
The $22 billion payments behemoth announced Stripe Capital this week, a provider of quick and easy to obtain loans for internet businesses. The company is expected to launch a card as well, according to TechCrunch’s Ingrid Lunden. What does that mean for recent upstarts like Clearbanc, a business that provides revenue-share agreements to help startups forgo selling equity to VCs, or Brex, which has created a credit card tailored for startups? Stiff competition ahead.
Led by brothers Patrick and John Collison, Stripe is known for developing payment processing software to facilitate online purchases. Doubling down on financial services, the company seeks to become the go-to capital provider to its millions of customers. In a vacuum, it’s no threat to Brex, which has quickly become a fintech darling (with a multibillion-dollar valuation to prove it) — but coupled with Stripe’s massive network, resources and the soon-to-be-announced card, it’s worth concern.
I reached out to both Brex and Clearbanc. Here’s what they had to say.
Clearbanc: “Stripe is one of our close partners because we’re both deeply committed to empowering founders. There’s a huge demand amongst founders for flexible funding that allow them to grow while retaining equity in their company, so it’s encouraging to see the growth of alternative funding options. We’re seeing this first hand — we’re investing an average of $100,000 of growth capital per brand, with other companies taking up to $10 million. New funding alternatives not only open more doors for more businesses, but data-driven platforms can also help to reduce bias and promote entrepreneurship outside of VC capitals like Silicon Valley and New York.”
Brex CEO Henrique Dubugras: “We have created a new financial stack for tech companies, and this has resulted in a very innovative product experience with lots of adoption, so it makes sense that Stripe would also pursue this fast-growing opportunity.”
We’ll share more details on the card as soon as possible.
WeWork slashes expectations
The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the company formerly known as WeWork is considering slashing its valuation as it looks to woo public market investors. The co-working biz may hit the public markets at a valuation of somewhere in the $20 billion range for its initial public offering, a figure that’s far less than the $47 billion valuation it received when it raised its last round of private funding. Yikes…
TechCrunch Disrupt
We are just weeks away from our flagship conference, TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco. We have dozens of amazing speakers lined up. In addition to taking in the great line-up of speakers, ticket holders can roam around Startup Alley to catch the more than 1,000 companies showcasing their products and technologies. And, of course, you’ll get the opportunity to watch the Startup Battlefield competition live. Past competitors include Dropbox, Cloudflare and Mint… You never know which future unicorn will compete next.
You can take a look at the full agenda here. Here’s a look at the panels I personally will be onstage moderating.
Brex CEO Henrique Dubugras and Clearbanc president Michele Romanow will discuss the evolving fintech ecosystem and both startups’ ultra-fast growth.
Slack co-founder Cal Henderson and Slack investor, Spark Capital’s Megan Quinn, will discuss the past, present and future of the now ubiquitous workplace messaging tool.
Postmates CEO Bastian Lehmann will sit down for a one-on-one conversation on what’s next for the food delivery business.

"content": "PrimaryBid, a UK-regulated platform connecting publicly listed companies with everyday investors for discounted share issuances has previously raised $3M. It’s now upped those stakes with an $8.6M funding round, led by UK VCs Pentech and Outward VC with participation from new and existing investors. Craig Anderson, a partner at Pentech, will join the PrimaryBidBoard of Directors with Outward VC having a Board Observer seat.
This investment is representative of the trend towards unpacking complex financial investment products for the average person, especially in the UK.
The FCA-regulated platform recently made a long-term commercial agreement with Euronext, the leading pan-European exchange in the Eurozone. The partnership gives the company access to nine new geographies, with the first new site launching in France later this year.
Commenting, Anand Sambasivan, co-founder and CEO of PrimaryBid, said: “Everyday investors are a vital part of the stock market and yet unable to buy discounted share deals – a longstanding imbalance in the public markets. This is true whether it is a government selling down its holding in a large company or a quoted company is raising growth capital. Our platform addresses this challenge, giving small investors the same access as traditionally afforded to large institutional investors.”
Investors can tap into PrimaryBid’s centralizing infrastructure that allows access to everyday investors as part of a share issuance, including block sales. The inclusion of retail investors can improve pricing and liquidity outcomes for their clients. The company’s solution allows private investors to participate, at the same time and the same price, delivering open access regardless of the size of their investment. The service is free of charge for investors, from £100 upwards.
PrimaryBid doesn’t have competitors because Retail investors have not previously had access to discounted equity offerings run by investment banks. This is because the retail investment market is too fragmented, and these deals are highly time-sensitive. As a result, only clients of Investment Banks (i.e. institutional investors) could previously access these attractive deals.
So now, listed companies that want to raise more capital on the stock exchange by issuing new shares can now connect with retail investors and offer these retail investors these shares at the same discounted rates as those offered to institutional investors. “In the past, these retail investors just couldn’t access these attractive deals for these new shares,” explains Sambasivan.
Craig Anderson of Pentech said: “We believe equity capital markets infrastructure is dominated by an institutional focus and is not geared for retail investors, which unfairly restricts consumer access to the primary equity markets. PrimaryBid addresses this problem by using technology to democratize the equity capital markets to provide a new asset class to retail investors.”
Kevin Chong of Outward VC said: “By bringing publicly listed companies directly to ordinary investors, PrimaryBid addresses increasing frustrations felt by equity issuers and potentially expands global equity markets to the benefit of all players – investors, issuers and investment bank advisers.”
Pentech previously invested in Nutmeg (which recently closed a £45m funding round led by Goldman Sachs) . Outward VC has previously backed Monese, Curve and Bud."

"content": "Roku  TV today represents more than 1 in 3 smart TVs sold in the U.S. Now, the company is bringing its TV licensing program to European markets. At the consumer tech show IFA in Berlin, Roku announced it will now allow manufacturers to license its TV reference designs and use its Roku OS to build smart TVs for sale in Europe. It also said Hisense would be its first European Roku TV partner.
Today, the connected TV market is no longer limited to just the dongles, sticks, and streaming media players that plug into the HDMI ports of consumers’ TV sets.
Top companies like Roku, Google and Amazon are also making their operating systems and reference designs available to TV makers themselves, in a battle to gain consumer market share. Apple has been rumored to be working on its own television set powered by tvOS, as well.
Roku, to date, done well on this front in its home market, after first introducing the Roku TV platform at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2014. Hisense was then one of its first partners on the effort. Fast-forward to 2019, and there are now over 100 models available from over 10 brands in North America, and the company estimates that Roku TV is now the No. 1 selling smart TV OS in the U.S.
Roku isn’t alone in targeting Europe with its TV platform. Amazon this week announced more than 20 new Fire TV devices, 15 of which were TVs licensing its Fire OS. Many of these were also aimed at European consumers through partnerships with local brands and retailers.
The new Hisense Roku TV models will support 4K Ultra HD resolutions and HDR, and will come in sizes ranging up to 65 inches, Roku says. The models will launch in the U.K. in the fourth quarter.
“While consumers love Roku TV’s simplicity and advance features, TV manufacturers benefit from the low manufacturing cost, a variety of technology options, and support from Roku,” said Roku CEO and Founder Anthony Wood, in a statement. “The ability to quickly bring to market a leading smart TV experience that is regularly updated by Roku and is packed with entertainment gives TV manufacturers an edge in the competitive TV business. We are pleased to bring the Roku TV licensing program to Europe and look forward to the first Hisense Roku TVs in market this year,” he said."

"content": "India’s attempt to become the first nation to soft land a robotic spacecraft at the moon’s South Pole, an unexplored region, has ended in failure, the space agency said Saturday.
Less than two miles above the lunar surface, the Vikram lander (named after Vikram Sarabhai, the father of India’s space program) lost communications with the mission control.
A live broadcast from ISRO, India’s equivalent of NASA, showed scientists grow tense as the control station struggled to get a signal from the lander.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was watching the landing attempt, offered words of encouragement to the scientists and children, who had accompanied him at the ISRO campus.
“Be courageous. Our faith in ISRO has not lost. I can proudly say that the effort was worth it and so was the journey. We are full of confidence that when it comes to our space program, the best is yet to come,” he said.
Space is hard. The lunar surface is filled with debris of spacecrafts that have attempted and failed to land in one piece. Because there is little to no atmosphere on the moon, parachutes can’t be used, leaving landers to rely completely on thrusters to modulate the speed.
Chandrayaan-2, a roughly $140 million mission, is, in part, intended to study moon craters that are believed to contain water deposits, something Chandrayaan-1 found in 2008.
A successful touchdown would have made India the fourth country to successfully complete a soft landing on the lunar surface. So far, only the former Soviet Union, the U.S., and China have accomplished it. The 142-foot tall spacecraft that blasted off Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on July 15 carried an orbiter, a lunar lander, and a six-wheeled rover. The lander and rover were expected to operate for just a couple of weeks, but the orbiter, which detached from the lander earlier this week, will continue to operate for about seven years, the space agency said.
ISRO has come a long way and specialized in low-cost space launches since the early 1960s, when components of rockets were transported by bicycles and assembled by hand in the country.
In 2013, ISRO also launched an orbiter to Mars in its maiden $74 million interplanetary mission — a fraction of the $671 million NASA spent for a Mars mission in the same year. In 2017, ISRO also deployed a record 104 satellites into space in just 18 minutes. Earlier this year, ISRO said it intends to have its own space station in the future and conduct separate missions to study the Sun and Venus. It will begin working on its space station following its first manned mission to space, called Gaganyaan (which means “space vehicle” in Sanskrit), in 2022 — just in time to commemorate 75 years of the country’s independence from Britain. The government has sanctioned Rs 10,000 crores ($1.5 billion) for the Gaganyaan mission."
